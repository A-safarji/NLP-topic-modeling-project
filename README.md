## Project info
NLP project: in order to work on NLP topic modeling we used Reddit to take posts, and do the topic modelling for each subreddit.


## Questions

* To do NLP topic modeling, it is a critical task to work on. To do so, this job must follow these important questions:

                * What are the most subreddit the affect specification?
                * Does the model perform well on other samples?
                * What are the best posts in the topic modeling?


## Why Riddet Toping Modeling?

* To organize, understand and summarize large collections of textual information.

* Make it easy for the Reddit community to use unsupervised topic modeling and advance in technology as people discuss in text format.   


## Tools
Language: Python3:
* Data manipulation: NumPy and Pandas 
* Modeling: Sklearn 
* Visualization: matlibplot, plotly and seaborn 
* NLP:PyCaret NLP, gensim, nltk,scipy
* Others: pyLDAvis, pylab,pickle, and regex
