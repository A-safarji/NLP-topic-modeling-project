0,any good military text-based rpg?,"Hey guys

I used to play a game from Storm8 called World War, and there's basically a clone out now called Battlecry: World at War... Trouble is Storm8 shut their game down and Battlecry has its fair share of problems.

That being said, I love the style of game, like a text based RPG with a military theme... I was wondering if any game enthusiasts out there know of any other good ones that aren't highly pay to win?

Many thanks"
1,FC 6 Defeat Admiral Benitez BROKEN,"In one try I fell trough a “floor” into broken video game wall hell. Then second time, after turning off poison and killing all soldiers in the courtyard, my two guerrilla helpers would not move from behind the open gate near the courtyard. I could not trigger the sequence to start working the canon. 

So I simply gave up and went to do something else

PS 5

Ubisoft please fix!"
2,Games with great sound design,"We can all appreciate good sound, right? But what are the games that have excellent sound overall? I'm a big fan of immersion through sound, and with recent purchase of a good pair of headphones and a DAC, I came to love some games even more, because of it.  
For instance, Little Nightmares 2 just drips atmosphere, and devs did a great job with its sound that just elevates it to the next level.  
Just on this subreddit I saw a post where STALKER 2 team is out on the field with guns blazing, mics recording. It's always great to see when developers don't rely on lifeless sound libraries, but tend to create something new.  
Also, The Last of Us Part 2 has awesome sound that brought rainy Seattle to life.  
On the other hand, there are remakes like the recent GTA Trilogy, that compress sound so it's worse than in the original.  
How important is the sound design to you, and what games could you recommend?"
3,Remedy to open a new studio in Sweden,
4,I need a game recommendation,"Hi all,

I'm 72, retired, and bored to tears. My thing is reading novels and I'm exhausted by reading two to three novels a week, I need to do something different.

I'm not interested in shooting games or games of that ilk, or multiplayer games. I'd like to have something where I can explore and meander through a game, not necessarily looking to solve clues - unless they are easy.

I was thinking about Red Dead Redemption 2 - it looks stunning - and I was wondering if the game can be played in this mode.

Also not looking to install steam either.

Would RDR2 be good for this on a PC? Maybe another game for the PC?

Finally, I have a self-built  i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz, GEForce 1080Ti, on an ASUS ROG Maximus X Hero. I know it's old, but it runs fine and I never get the BSOD. Running Windows 11 BTW.

Thanks."
5,Why did Valve made that terrible card game?,"I like Valve since they usually do a good job being a private corporation and listening to fans, so am not sure whether to say if they wanted to make a quick cash grab, if it was generally a big mistake that they learned from(which never happens), or if they really like money. I always thought they liked money from all the online multiplayer games they made and abandoned but just usually did the right corporate decisions most of the time.

Of course I know a lot of terrible corporations but am generally asking what f\*cking valve was doing?

Edit: Changed battle royale to online multiplier because I have no fricking idea what they mean."

12,With r/gaming's 'easy mode-no grinding' repost can we talk about gamer entitlement around this concept of 100% completion vs story completion?,"I  am not arguing against accessibility options, nor am I against  difficulty options when the experience doesn't center around a tuned  challenge. But this has been a long-time pet peeve of mine: this idea  that everyone should be entitled to the *complete* 100% experience of a game, regardless of skill level and time investment ability.

The  'popular' complaint about not having time to grind feels overblown. How  many games require you to be committing to extraneous grinding to  complete the main story? Not optional content, not max level, not secret  bosses. Main story. It absolutely does happen but it seems to be even  rarer each year. However, in my experience often I find myself  over-leveled until I am through the story. And I am often playing in  hard mode to buff this effect down.

The  other version of this problem is what I refer to as the korok seed  dilemma. Where developers put in enough unique challenges or tasks that  any player's path will likely get a fairly similar number of them in  their playtime or to enhance play time for those who want it.  Unfortunately what then happens is some folks now feel 'cheated' or  overwhelmed with the prospect of getting every single challenge down or  complain when there isn't a novel reward for completion.

The  900 korok seeds are a great example, as are Celeste's strawberries.  With the korok seeds, specifically, Nintendo brilliantly filled an open  world to accommodate all paths and avoided a meaningful incentive for  getting even HALF of them. Despite this, I know at least a couple of  examples of players feeling incredibly annoyed or even losing interest  in them altogether upon learning of the total count. ...y tho?

Anyway, my 3 hot takes on all this are:

1. Developers often design games toward mass appeal, but are under no obligation to.
2. Sometimes appealing to those masses negates the experience of others. And that can go both ways.
3. The  ""As a parent""/""as a full-time worker""/ ""as a blah blah"" is one side of  the coin the other is ""I liked it, but it felt too short.""

Can  you think of some great examples of the benefit of not appealing to the  masses? For me, I can't bear to play any 'Souls' games and fully  understand they are great games that just aren't for me. Despite how  much I want them to be.

How about games that fall victim to mass appeal?  


Edit: So many awesome, insightful replies and thoughts and only one truly embarrassing comment. Another day I am so proud to be a (unsolicited and grumpy) gamer."

Think back to any recent release and they've always done a gameplay overview, but obviously that's not the case with this remaster. 

Add the fact that theres still a review embargo in place, Rockstar knew exactly what they were pitting out. 

Ive played a few hours of San Andreas on GamePass, and good God are there a boat load of glaring issues.

Why is there even an option for fidelity and performance? A game this old should give you the best of both worlds. 

One of the most frustrating is the fact that when it rains, you can't really see what the hells happening on screen, as the streaks of rain look like theyre white, not transparent. 

This is a prime example of a corporation trying to pull a fast one on a loyal fanbase. 

I know this is just the reddit echo chamber but if this dissuades even five people from buying the game, its worth it."

50,Immersive Playthrough," 

Is it just me or anyone else finds more enjoyable to play an ""immersive playthrough"" instead of a free-action one?

Let me explain:

I'll use one of my favorite games of all time, Red Dead Redemption 2, as an example. The plot is established, as the solid, believable and extraordinay world is there too. The characters have their own personality, convictions and beliefs.

It's clear who Arthur Morgan is, and is also clear what his objectives are. I know, it's a western-themed videogame, and the player has the freedom to shootout an entire town, massacre people, and then just go fishing to regain his honor and get out as the good cowpoke.

Yeah, the game gives you this possibility, but... would Arthur **do that?**

You have the option to save and reload, and thats nice because if you ever fuck up your playthrough you just go back and do things in a different way. That is not what I'm talking about.

I'm talking about not killing innocent folk - EVER. I'm talking about getting to your destination just by walking - not running like a desperate psycopath or as if Arthur's TB is on the next street by chapter 2, or 3, or anytime before last mission.

I'm talking about respecting the game characters, story and its pace, you know?

Of course, you can assume that Arthur is a bad man, and that he would kill innocent people over some bucks, but would he kill a person just to steal his horse and get faster to Mary's mission?!

I think you might get my point here.

In my playthough, I didn't run when I thought Arthur wouldn't. I walked, like a real person would do. I wouldn't buy clothes at the beginning or end of the game: what's the point? There are far more concerning matters than looking pretty in the wild land.

I wouldn't try to explore Saint Denis in chapter 2: that doesnt make sense, we're trying to head WEST! I would drink coffee at camp every morning, I wouldn't spam X on my horse to get to my destination.

I used RDR2 as an example, but I often to this kind of playthough in every narrative-driven game I play: Assassin's Creed, GTA, Batman Arkham Series, Spider Man...

And sometimes it feels like I'm crazy. And yeah, I even respect the red lights in GTA.

Is there anyone out there that shares this play style?"

>Bright Memory Infinite is still at best a visual tech demo. It's lack of quality of life updates and extremely short play time still makes me wonder if this was the full game to begin with. Still, the gun blasting and blade swinging action is bombastically fun. After all, this game was developed by one person alone. So kudos to Zeng Xian Cheng.

>Less a sum of its parts, Bright Memory: Infinite depends heavily on its action and visual quality without delivering a complete experience entirely worthy of the hype.

>Bright Memory: Infinite has a nascent vision of what it wants to be. And honestly, that vision is kind of good. With the right elements around it, Bright Memory: Infinite’s combat could have shined. Unfortunately, everything else is an incoherent mishmash of undeveloped ideas, lazy design, sloppiness, and technical problems. Even at the budget price of $9.99 I can’t recommend this mess.

>Bright Memory Infinite is a disappointing follow-up to a prelude that made its share of promises. It's a shame because a polished expansion on the original concept would have had a certain cult appeal, whereas Infinite feels watered down. It's a pretty game, and best of all it's free for those who lashed out for the prelude, but in the end, it plays like a game that got spooked by its own shadow and is a result of improbable ambition.

>Despite all my problems with Infinite, it’s a game made by a single developer (for the most part) that was amazing looking enough that Xbox wanted to tie it to its then next-gen, now current-gen console. While Infinite isn’t available on Xbox Series yet, it will be, and on PC has some amazing visuals that are worthy of your attention.

>For the most part I can overlook a bad story. Hell, I enjoy Call of Duty campaigns from time to time. However, with how thin it already is and with a very anticlimactic ending, I didn’t feel like much was accomplished. Luckily, the gameplay made up for a lot of what was missing story wise. All-in-all I was left with the feeling of wanting more. I want the game to be longer because I want to keep fighting.

-------------

**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [6.5 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2021/11/11/reviews/129370-pc-review-bright-memory-infinite/)

>Bright Memory: Infinite looks incredible for a game from a small development team, and the core sword-and-gun gameplay is fun enough. However, everything surrounding those two elements feel unpolished and poorly thought-out. The incoherent story, the non-combat gameplay mechanics, and general lack of quality control drag down the entire thing. If you're looking for a quick and breezy shooter to tide you over for an afternoon, Infinite might be fun for you. Otherwise, there's nothing here that you can't see in videos that show off its rain-soaked beauty.

>Battlefield 2042 brings the sandbox back to the series in bold and controversial ways. The new Specialist system might seem like sacrilege at first, but it opens up gameplay opportunities that weren't possible in previous titles. The massive, well-designed maps offer plenty of room for experimentation and emergent stories, and the modes are a blast. And that's just All-Out Warfare. Between that, Hazard Zone, and the expansive Battlefield Portal, Battlefield 2042 has something for everyone, without feeling like it's stretched too thin. It's a true evolution of the series, one that pushes back against a stagnation that threatened the series' future. It won't be for everyone, but for players who crave imagination and fun from their Battlefields, it will give them everything that they crave and more.

>Battlefield 2042 has a lot going on inside its three play zones. I'm excited to keep playing the hectic new maps with weather events, head back into the Hazard Zone with the specialists to try and make it out with some loot, and put my nostalgia goggles back on when I play some more of my favourite Battlefield maps in Portal. Stay tuned for my full review in the coming week.

>Although some specialists can feel a bit useless at times, tweaks to the formula with Battlefield 2042 add a lot of interesting gameplay variety.

>The title being keen to expand via its future Battlepass, it will be necessary to judge the content in the long term to see whether or not it is up to the task. But as it stands, we are facing a Battlefield of high quality, and worthy of the name.

**[GamingTrend](https://opencritic.com/outlet/102/gamingtrend)** - [Anthony Shelton](https://opencritic.com/critic/1614/anthony-shelton) - [Unscored](https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/battlefield-2042-review/)

>Battlefield 2042 felt like an eternity away, but now it’s only a little over one week from release. After spending three days with other media types playing the next giant war game, I can finally say it’s ambitious but isn’t able to match the ambition so far. I say so far because while we did play online with our group and while we did have at least 4 hours with each mode (some of us had six with Breakthrough), that’s not enough to properly assess modes like Hazard Zone and Portal. I also don’t know if they’re going to start the battle pass during the early access period. So for now, check out my review-in-progress.

**[Hardcore Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/23/hardcore-gamer)** - [Kevin Dunsmore](https://opencritic.com/critic/892/kevin-dunsmore) - [3.5 / 5](https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=414406)

>Battlefield 2042 is a fun game to play, but its base game content will leave you wanting. Thankfully, Battlefield Portal is there to pick up the slack and does so splendidly. There’s still some gas left in Battlefield’s tank.

-------------

**[Metro GameCentral](https://opencritic.com/outlet/75/metro-gamecentral)** - [Patrick Dane](https://opencritic.com/critic/3941/patrick-dane) - [Unscored](https://metro.co.uk/2021/11/11/battlefield-2042-review-in-progress-the-cod-killer-15582341/)

>Due to the restricted amount of time we’ve had with each of the modes, we’re going to wait and see how the game evolves after the first few days. Battlefield 2042 is hard to judge right now, because it will live and die by player engagement. Seeing what the broader player base does with the tools and spaces it provides will be important in trying to gauge exactly how good the overall experience is.

**[PCGamesN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/169/pcgamesn)** - [Christian Vaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/1952/christian-vaz) - [Unscored](https://www.pcgamesn.com/battlefield-2042/review-pc)

>This is still a giant playground packed with catalysts and gadgets that are ready and waiting to be worked into a player-made set piece. It feels as cool as ever when you manage to create one of these in the middle of a match, and it’s in these moments when Battlefield asserts itself in the multiplayer FPS space. However, I’m still unsure how Battlefield 2042 will shape up on launch day. My experience has varied wildly across three lengthy sessions with the game, but I’m hopeful that some of the issues I’ve encountered will be addressed in an upcoming patch. When everything works, Battlefield 2042 is easily my favourite game in the series. But as of now, it doesn’t always work.

>Essentially, I'm going to spend a few more days in the trenches to get a better handle on what appears to be, at the time of writing, a promise-filled yet obviously imperfect sequel.

**[Press Start](https://opencritic.com/outlet/491/press-start)** - [Toby Berger](https://opencritic.com/critic/1261/toby-berger) - [8.5 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/ps5-reviews/2021/11/11/battlefield-2042-review-a-fantastic-blend-of-future-meets-past/)

>It's not without its issues, but Battlefield 2042 is off to a fantastic start for DICE's beloved series. All-Out Warfare modes are immersive, Hazard Zone is enjoyable while Battlefield Portal steals the show. There's a lot to love here, and I'm excited to see where the game goes.

-------------

**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Luke Lawrie](https://opencritic.com/critic/3164/luke-lawrie) - [4.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/battlefield-2042-review-oldies-are-the-goodies/)

>In a world where developers are getting used to working from home and games are being pushed back due to the global pandemic, EA decided that Battlefield 2042 was ready for this year. It’s not. More time is needed to fix a lot of the problems, but even then that might not be enough to save it from being one of the most lacklustre Battlefield titles yet.

-------------

**[The Games Machine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine)** - [Alessandro Alosi](https://opencritic.com/critic/6452/alessandro-alosi) - *Italian* - [9 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/battlefield-2042-pc-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x-s/battlefield-2042-recensione/)

>Battlefield 2042 is a brave new chapter in the history of the series, full of interesting elements and very well done in many respects. Between the evolution of total warfare, the addition of Hazard Zone and the innovative Portal editor, DICE has done things big, and big is the passion that lies behind this new, monumental shooter.

-------------

**[Wccftech](https://opencritic.com/outlet/304/wccftech)** - [Alessio Palumbo](https://opencritic.com/critic/1304/alessio-palumbo) - [Unscored](https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-2042-the-ultimate-battlefield/)

>Battlefield 2042 feels like the most complete Battlefield game yet, mainly thanks to the incredible depth provided by Battlefield Portal and the brand new Hazard Mode, even though it is unclear whether it'll be enough to draw flocks of new players to the franchise.

-------------

**[WellPlayed](https://opencritic.com/outlet/382/wellplayed)** - [Adam Ryan](https://opencritic.com/critic/5704/adam-ryan) - [8 / 10](https://www.well-played.com.au/battlefield-2042-review/)

>Heading in a multiplayer-only direction, 2042 offers a unique blend of experiences that combines classic Battlefield sensibilities with fresh new ideas, making for a game filled with exciting content to explore whether you’re a returning veteran or a series newbie.

**Comments by Previewers:**

VGC:

>Elden Ring  provides the Dark Souls formula with its biggest challenge yet. A  genuine attempt at an open-world version of the series, and from what  we’ve played, it pulls it off spectacularly.

Washington Post:

>‘Elden Ring’ is shaping up to be a dream come true

FextraLife:

>Elden Ring is some of the most fun I’ve  had this year, and I literally played almost without sleep for an entire  weekend that flew by. And I was just playing what is likely just a  small fraction of this massive game. I finished the demo with each and  every Class, and tested all spells and most of the weapons and their  skills, and I have a fairly good idea of what the Network Test has to  offer, and it is grand indeed.

IGN:

>I’ve put almost 15 hours into just this Closed Test alone, going through  each of the five starting classes and putting them through their paces,  and I’m still having a blast. If the full version of Elden Ring  continues to match the quality of open-world design found within just  this first area, then we’re in for a very special game come February of  next year.

Eurogamer:

>NOT TO BRAG (much), but i've sunk 20+ hours into an early access look at Elden Ring and i still can't get enough.

I have been super busy with everything in my life taking my time up - from work, to becoming a Canadian permanent resident (yay!). However, the whole time I have been itching to get back to making these posts again, and hopefully you all still have the same interest in learning about some interesting stories.

So for those who aren't familiar, I take a trip down memory lane looking at all the major leaks and rumours leading up to a game's release. While I would love to examine every single rumour, I only really touch on the ones that gain traction within the gaming community.

This post takes a look at Resident Evil: Village (RE8), and the many nuggets of information we discover up to the game's release on May 7, 2021. The much awaited sequel comes after the two excellent remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3, and is a direct sequel to 2017's Resident Evil 7. Critically, the game was a success, receiving high praise from critics and players alike, with many waiting for any upcoming news for DLC. So, without further ado, let's dive in!

I should also mention, **SPOILER WARNING FOR THE WHOLE GAME**, you have been warned!
# May 27, 2019 - Hookman to REturn?

[IB Times reports](https://www.ibtimes.com/resident-evil-8-will-feature-hook-man-more-bioweapons-insiders-say-2795247) that RE leaker ""EVIL VR"" has leaked some pieces of information for the upcoming game. The claims include that the game's enemies will be newly infected scientists who are beginning to mutate - but aren't zombies. They also go on to claim that the Hook Man from the RE4 trailers is making a return to the series, who only showed up in promotional material. Finally, the leak claims that the trailer will be revealed at E3 2019.

**Outcome?** *False*. All incorrect.

#January 20, 2020 - REveal date leaked?

[GameRanx reports that a 4Chan leak](https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-8-reveal-date-when/) claims that RE8 will be revealed at the Playstation 5 reveal event on February 5, 2020. Not much else to say about this.

**Outcome?** *False.*

#January 21, 2020 - RE8 Development REbooted and Years Away From RElease?

Those familiar with Resident Evil (RE) leaks will no doubt be no stranger to the name [DuskGolem](https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1). Golem is a notorious leaker for almost anything RE, and while their track record may be hit or miss, it is hard to argue that they do have at least some insider knowledge. Way back in January 2020, Golem claims that RE8 development has been rebooted, and not to expect the game for [""a few years""](https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1219565160160849921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1219565160160849921%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbiohazardcast.com%2Fresident-evil-8-may-not-be-soon-unfortunately-rumor%2F). 

The leaker claims that development began as early as 2016, but was put on the back burner as Capcom needed more hands for the RE7 DLC. He then goes on to state that the version of RE8 being developed at this time is only 6-7 months old, and that the game is still years away. He does also claim that 2021 will see the release of a new Resident Evil game, but it won't be RE8 or a remake of an older classic in the series.

**Outcome?** *False*. While it is possible that he did hear this information that development had gone through a reboot, the game did end up releasing in 2021.

# January 28, 2020 - First Details Emerge

Courtesy of an [article posted by Biohazard Cast](https://biohazardcast.com/possible-resident-evil-8-rumors-rumor/) we receive our first rumours about the next instalment in the series. The information comes as a direct follow up to the previous claims by DuskGolem, basically stating that these claims are false, while sending in some of their own insider information through the site's ""anonymous tipline"". The interesting pieces of information are as follows 

 > Ethan will be returning as a playable character. **TRUE**

>  Resident Evil 8 was tested last year. **PLAUSIBLE**

> It will not be called Resident Evil 8, but will have a “clever title”. **TRUE**

>  The game will be in First-person like RE7. **TRUE**

>  Gameplay starts in a village leading up to a castle. **TRUE**

>  The environment will be rural, snowy, and mountainous; possibly Europe. **TRUE**

>  Regular zombies will be appearing instead of the Molded from RE7. **ALMOST TRUE**

>  There is a persistent shadowy “female” enemy that will follow you but will dissipate if shot. **TRUE**

>  There are also wolf-like creatures that will attack the player in certain areas. **TRUE**

>  Chris Redfield will also be returning in some capacity. **TRUE**
 
A very interesting tip, as it turns out that this is all very accurate information, and nothing is incorrect. It is safe to assume that this insider was very close to the development team as the hinting of a clever game title in particular stands out to me as peculiar.

**Outcome?** Accurate. Genuine leak.

# April 3, 2020 - Ethan REturns, FPS, originally REvelations 3?

Once again, according to [DuskGolem](https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1246271327167602688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1246271327167602688%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.altchar.com%2Fgame-news%2Frumour-resident-evil-8-is-first-person-cross-gen-and-set-for-reveal-in-next-few-months-amTvb8e28Lxd), the next entry in the series is a ""massive departure"" from previous games, and that it will be a tough pill to swallow for RE purists.

The article covers the claims that playable protagonist from RE7, Ethan, returns in this game as the playable character. He also supports the claims of it being set in a village and feature werewolves. However, the biggest claim is that purists will hate it as it covers themes of ""occultism, insanity, and not being able to trust others"".

**Outcome?** *Accurate.* However, seems to be rehashing what others have previously said, no new information.

# April 6, 2020 - Test Demo Details Leaked!

It seems that the anonymous tipper strikes again, as [Biohazard Cast received more information, this time about some demos that insiders got to play.](https://biohazardcast.com/new-rumors-arise-about-resident-evil-8/)

It seems that insiders got the chance to play the now titled Resident Evil: Village earlier in 2020, and that there were multiple versions of the demo available for the players. Before jumping into their differences, lets cover some similarities. Both of them featured Ethan as the playable character, both of them featured the same village introduction, and both of them introduced a witch character that would stalk the character. The village was infested with ""wolf-men"" in both demos, and both featured a chase sequence that went down a little bit differently. Finally, there is mention of a [""gorilla-like monster man with chains and a staff"".](https://www.relyonhorror.com/latest-news/sources-resident-evil-8-village-test-demo-details-leak/)

Now, the differences. While both demos did feature series favourite Chris REdfield, insiders were noted saying that some versions of Chris looked like his RE7 counterpart, and that others looked entirely different. Additionally, Mia did feature in an opening sequence with one demo having her pregnant with Ethan's child, and an alternate demo having the child already been born. Another big difference in the demo comes when the player would get to the town - during an escape sequence some players were given weapons, while others were given nothing and purely had to run. Depending on your demo, the wolves were called off by either a bell ringing, or something unseen calling them away. Finally, to quote RelyOnHorror 

> Some versions of the demo appear to have you escape to a castle, while others have you meet up with a group of normal, human villagers and talk your way into their refuge to hide out from the monsters. One of the villagers inside begins to hallucinate, and eventually lashes out and begins to butcher the other villagers. You manage to escape with one of the other villagers, a woman who helped you into the house, as the hallucinating villager sets it ablaze. The demo ends here. 

**Outcome?** *Confirmed.* Everyone who is familiar with the game can see the definite resemblance in these early tech demos to the final product.

# April 12, 2020 - PSVR Confirmed?

According to a report from [Gematsu](https://www.gematsu.com/2020/04/rumor-resident-evil-4-remake-in-development-at-m-two), not only is a Resident Evil 4 remake in the works and coming out in 2022, RE8 will allegedly support PSVR - according to their sources.

**Outcome?** *False.* Their source sucks.

#May 8, 2020 - Multiple Villains and an ... Alan?

Once again, [DuskGolem strikes again,](https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1258826933007085568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1258826933007085568%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechplusgame.com%2Fresident-evil-8-gruesome-title-villains-confirmed%2F) this time claiming that RE8 will feature more than one villain, and makes reference to a character named Alan? 

> There's one unconfirmed thing I heard I'll throw at you involving a guy named Alan, I'm partially sharing that bit to stir the kettle some I admit though

Whatever this ended up being... I have no idea. But, yep, he was right about about multiple villains (even if it had been alluded to earlier).

**Outcome?** *Accurate-ish*, I guess, but the one specific piece of information is wrong, and everyone could guess multiple villains.

#May 24, 2020 - Third Person Perspective, Claire and REbecca Dead

This leak comes courtesy of a 4Chan post that has since been deleted - [but here is a screen grab](https://imgur.com/a/lIncefs) of it before it went down! Couple of interesting pieces of information, claiming that a part from what we already know, the villain is a man named A. Coven, and is the leader of a group called The Connections. A second villain is Illona Simmons, who they claim will be the main villain of a future game.

It also claims third person perspective, and that Chris believes that Ethan is responsible for the death of Claire and REbecca. This leads to a confrontation at the end of the game where the player has the option to either kill or keep Chris alive. 

**Outcome?** *Completely false.*

#May 29, 2020 - REveal at PS5 Event?

According to insider [Okabe over on resetera](https://www.resetera.com/threads/update-delayed-ps5-event-set-for-thursday-june-4-at-1-00pm-pacific-time.215355/page-4#post-35328657), we are likely to see a reveal for either RE8 or the new Silent Hills game at the PS5 reveal event on June 4, or at June 10 at a different event.

**Outcome?** *Correct*. RE8 was revealed at the PS5 event (albeit on a delayed date), and Silent Hill still doesn't officially exist.

# June 5, 2020 - More Story Details Emerge?

[BHD](https://biohazardcast.com/more-interesting-resident-evil-8-rumours/) once again seem to be a go to if you want to hear about the latest rumours regarding RE8. 

Just to summarize what the article says, it supports previous rumours that hallucinations will play a major part in this game, but it is cause by the virus being airborne and having a reaction on the player. We get a second reference to a character called ""Alan R"", allegedly a mysterious count living in a castle that the players can access - with a secondary villain named Natalia/Alex Weskler.

We also hear about a second playable character titled Emily, who is a mountain resident who the player is helping find her father. While she does feature in the game, it is a minor role and isn't playable. The article also mentions an interesting gameplay idea that would involve the player using a flashlight to light up dimly lit areas, with batteries being a resource the player must scavenge.

They also outline some story elements for the game, writing;

>Mia and Ethan have a child. They live a pretty lonely life in a remote place and try to hide their child. However, Chris Redfield breaks into Ethan’s house, ending in the execution of Mia. Apparently, he is operating on his own and that is not part of official operation.

>When Ethan wakes up, Chris is gone. He did not leave Mia to die but bandaged her. There are some shadowy figures in the room. Ethan is abducted there and then wakes up in the ‘Village’.

**Outcome?** *False*

# June 11, 2020 - Resident Evil Village Announced!

[Here's the trailer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRpXEc-EJow&ab_channel=PlayStation) Interesting to note just how much of this didn't make the final game...

# November 15, 2020 - Capcom Hacked, Demo, RD Leaked?

In thanks to a ransomware attack on Capcom, it seems that hackers managed to get a tonne of information about the company's projects - including RE8. The leak covers that the game is intended to have a demo released to the public before the game's release in April 2021. It also alludes to the game releasing on (at the time) current-gen consoles which had been teased by Capcom saying it would be something they could look into.

The game's plot outline allegedly also leaked, as well the game's cutscenes and player models.[This thread on ResetEra covers it pretty well](https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-ransomware-leaks-thread-check-op-for-latest-contents.327053/).

**Outcome?** *Accurate.* As we will later see.

# December 26, 2020 - Major Cutscenes Leaked

As discovered in this [reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/ke8j9h/resident_evil_8_leaked_gameplaycutscenes/), a YouTube channel that has since been deleted somehow managed to get a hand on all the game's major cutscenes, basically spoiling the major story twists and beats. Poor Capcom. Once again, **major spoilers** for the game below. 

The cutscenes seem to be all the major ones for the end of the game, revealing the final boss, spoiling Ethan's death from Miranda, and how he actually comes back from the dead from this - he got infected from the events of RE7 which gives an explanation as to how he can heal from multiple seemingly life threatening injuries and amputations. Between Ethan's death and revival, we play as Chris, who is tasked with hunting Miranda but finds Mia. We also see Ethan detonating the bomb after defeating Miranda - destroying both himself and the village. Finally, the sequel-tease is leaked showing an older Rose (Ethan and Mia's daugther) visiting her father's grave.

**Outcome?** *Very real. All these cutscenes made the game's release.*

# April 16, 2021 - Dusk Golem Leaks MoREau Encounter

Capcom can't catch a break with RE Insider Dusk Golem once again grabbing the headlines [as he leaks everything he knows](https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1383018481138819076?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1383018481138819076%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechnclub.com%2Fgaming%2Fresident-evil-village-bosses-locations-leaked%2F) about the encounter with one of RE8's major villains, Moreau.

>I know his area plays a LOT like End of Zoe, you go through snowy forests & swamps, wade through water. There's Siren/Mermaid type enemies who can shriek to attack you, & when you're in water come for you, but there's items & such in the water you can try & collect, PLUS in his whole area, there's this giant Tyrant-esque monster that stalks you, but it's got this bloating up poison bag that spews acid. Then other weird things, his area is VERY culty, enemies doing rituals in the forests, he has
one of the biggest boss arenas in the entire series in this huge open area near the windmills that's like Krauser's arena, from RE4, but bigger, & then of course there's the boat section & lake monster.

**Outcome?** *Accurate.*

# April 22, 2021 - StREet Date Broken in Australia 

Lucky Twitter user [Kaiser499](https://twitter.com/Kaiser499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1385126511997562881%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=) managed to get an early copy of the game after a retailer in Australia accidentally broke the game's street date a whopping 16 days before the game's official release on May 7, 2021. Lucky.

**Outcome?** *Confirmed*. Definite lucky fan.

#May 7, 2021 - Resident Evil Village Releases!


# Closing Thoughts

It's hard not to feel sorry for Capcom having so much of the game's story leaked well before the game's release. What is good to note though, is that it seems it hasn't had much on the game's success, with the game selling more than Resident Evil 7 during the same time after launch - a nifty 3 million copies. 

It seems they are on to a winner with the formula, and that the shift to first-person is a decision that is paying off. On a personal level, Resident Evil Village is easily in my top three games I've played this year, with Resident Evil 7 being my game of the year for their year.

While I did love the story, based on just the reveal trailer alone, it seems that there were some rewrites and some big changes to the story between reveal and release. I would love to find out what was the version of the game that they revealed compared to what the game was that the player got to experience.

What are your thoughts? Did you enjoy the game, or did the story leaks put you off playing the game entirely? I decided not to include all the gameplay leaks as the game was nearing release as every game manages to have this as street dates are broken and review copies get out. 

For those who enjoyed this post and are interested in seeing other games get similar treatment, here is a list of game's I have previously written about;

145,Is it getting easier or harder to make games?,"Big AAA titles don't really like taking any sort of risks when it comes to games due to their cost and wanting to reach as wide of an audience as possible. They are usually the same kinds of games with the same kinds of themes. However, I feel like the quality in the smaller-than-AAA space, Indies for example, is becoming more high quality as years go by. So I really like the idea that for example, some weird and quirky character action games that have very little chance of existing in the AAA space could in the future be done by let's say 10 person indie teams. But this would of course require game development to become easier.

One example I guess would be Biomutant. I feel like a game like that which was done by 20 people wouldn't have been possible to make by such a small team let's say 10 years ago. Yeah, it's somewhat of a rough game still, but it makes me feel that game development is becoming easier as time goes by. Is it true or am I wrong?

In short, I really like the idea that small teams that can take more risks could produce games that aren't just the usual 2D side-scrollers more often than today."

>Unplugged is the long-awaited answer to the question “how cool is air guitar, really?” It turns out air guitar is actually Guitar Hero without the massive custom controller taking up space in your living room. Which is pretty cool! If you’ve got a head for rhythm games, along with a lingering fondness for timeless rock songs, there’s a lot to latch on to here. The hand tracking is better than you’d expect, although there are a couple of choke points to contend with. Furthermore, those quality motion controls can’t stop certain finger positions from being real bone-breakers. Small hitches aside, Unplugged is an unconventional, engaging interpretation of VR rhythm games.

>Unplugged is actually a pretty cool way to bring the Guitar Hero format to VR. I was really impressed with the hands tracking, and the setlist is largely good, with a few nice big name tracks along with some lively lesser known ones. I could deal with plenty less Satchel, and would prefer in his stead more direction on what I'm doing, but all and all Unplugged is a rockin' fun time.

>First impressions matter: from the people you meet, the look and feel of a restaurant, or the state of that used car you’re buying. Unplugged delivers that spark, that flutter in your chest, those hairs on the back of your neck that stand up, as you fire up the game and crunch your way through its 20-ish tracks.

>After a few drinks at a gig, the air guitar inevitably comes out, as I’m screaming lyrics to some of my favourite tunes. Now, I can do this in the comfort of my own home, without inflicting this misery on other people – and so can you!

>Unplugged is not the killer application that everyone expected, but as a rhythm game based on hand tracking and air guitar it's a game to be seriously considered.

>Unplugged is an interesting VR experiment that is bogged down by hand-tracking technology and strange design decisions. If you can ignore that, it's a whole lot of fun.

>Finally, hand tracking has been put to good use! I love air-guitaring with Unplugged, I just wish all the songs were available from the start.

>A lot of the enjoyment of Unplugged comes down to the hand-tracking technology that isn't fully there yet, and I'm doubtful that the current Quest hardware will ever fully get there. Better cameras on the headset are a minimum requirement for that to happen. In the meantime, if you can put up with its inevitable frustrations as you air-jam a hallucinated guitar to the tune of rock classics in your living room, Unplugged is one of the best and only games to use hand tracking. You will certainly get rewarded if you stick with it, but it likely won't completely overshadow its downsides.

Huge thanks as well to **Voidreaver** of [EXOR Studios](https://www.exorstudios.com/) for the super entertaining Riftbreaker run, where chat actively voted for all kinds of additional in-game punishment. 

Also, we'd like to thank the following publishers and developers for donating keys for us to give away during the event this year: Indie Bros, Vertigo Gaming, Whitethorn Games, William Chyr Studio and EXOR Studios. Thank you so much for helping out on such short notice! 

Lastly, thanks to the modteam and discord regulars who helped run and promote the event, and everyone who donated for the express purpose of watching AK torture himself with a gauntlet of hot sauces. See you all next year for Extra Life 2022!"

>There’s not much else I can say about Blue Reflection: Second Light. I often say that the original Blue Reflection is the most beautiful game. I say that because while it obviously didn’t compare to the AAA-blockbusters in terms of the money that has been thrown at it, the art direction was so pitch-perfect and downright beautiful that the technical limitations were irrelevant. Second Light clearly had a bigger budget and made the most of that to present a more refined and confident take on the Blue Reflection vision. The story is a vibrant, the JRPG action is classical and engaging, and the aesthetics are pristine. Getting something this wholesome and pure is a rare treat in an industry obsessed with hard and serious storytelling and adult themes, and I strongly suspect that, just like the original Blue Reflection, I’m not going to be able to get Second Light out of my mind for years to come.

I just wish the main story ever really became interesting. As a slice of life RPG, Second Light succeeds. As an apocalyptic epic, though, it falls short. This leaves a total package that lies somewhere in the middle.

>Blue Reflection: Second Light does a good job of building on what worked in the first adventure. It’s cute, the characters are charming, with deep enough mechanics to make gameplay engaging. It might not be perfect like stealth sections are fairly pointless, but fans of the previous or this style of RPG will enjoy it. Even if it’s only over the delightful visuals.

>I had looked forward to playing BLUE REFLECTION: Second Light and I can say it doesn’t disappoint. All the elements that make for a satisfying JRPG/simulation are here, and I can see Gust incorporated a lot of what makes Atelier Ryza a great game. Forming friendships, crafting things, making facilities, use of the FreeSpace app, exploring the Heartscapes, fighting….all merges quite satisfyingly. This also means that you must be in for the entire package. Focussing on the battles alone won’t let you progress, focussing on the simulation part won’t do the trick either.
>
>Follow Ao and her friends while they explore the Heartscapes and turn them into the best Reflectors they can be. BLUE REFLECTION: Second Light is a great game for Atelier fans, and I’m guessing it will be a hit with JRPG fans as well!

**[Niche Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/298/niche-gamer)** - NECRO XIII - [8.5 / 10](https://nichegamer.com/reviews/blue-reflection-second-light-review/)

>From initial impressions, I admittedly didn’t have much faith in this game, and how the premise would grab me. However I did find that the more time I spent, and the more I explored it, was more than I thought. Blue Reflection: Second Light is rough around the edges in the graphics department, but makes up with everything else for a trade-off.

-------------

**[NookGaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/768/nookgaming)** - [Thomas Knight](https://opencritic.com/critic/7286/thomas-knight) - [9 / 10](https://www.nookgaming.com/blue-reflection-second-light-review/)

>While I had my issues with the ending of Blue Reflection: Second Light and didn’t feel the overarching plot was amazing, it easily won me over with its strong focus on the characters and their relationships. All those little moments stood out far more than uncovering the mystery of what happened to them. Supported by a particularly solid set of gameplay systems for a JRPG, it’s worth the purchase.

-------------

**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Garri Bagdasarov](https://opencritic.com/critic/840/garri-bagdasarov) - [6 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/blue-reflection-second-light-ps4-a-surprising-sequel-that-fails-to-live-up-to-expectations/)

>It's a shame that Blue Reflection: Second Light couldn't live up to the expectations it set for itself. Though the story and characters development is good, the game is held back by overly complicated combat mechanics that seem to make encounters harder and longer when they didn't need to be. With the franchise now two games deep, I have to wonder if a third entry will ever get the light of day and if so, will GUST Studios finally be able to get the formula right.

>A fantastic game overall and one of Gust's best games to date.

>Blue Reflection: Second Light is a laid-back JRPG and a great improvement from its predecessor that makes several refinements across the board.

-------------

**[Rice Digital](https://opencritic.com/outlet/513/rice-digital)** - [Pete Davison](https://opencritic.com/critic/301/pete-davison) - [Unscored](https://ricedigital.co.uk/blue-reflection-second-light-review/)

>Blue Reflection: Second Light is an absolute triumph. And the sad thing is, if the first game is anything to go by, it’s likely to be all but ignored by a good 90% of the game-playing public and media alike.

-------------

**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [William Worrall](https://opencritic.com/critic/6057/william-worrall) - [8 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-reflection-second-light-review)

>Blue Reflection: Second Light does a lot of things right. If you don't mind some slight balance issues then the characters and mechanics should keep you interested the entire game through.

-------------

**[The Outerhaven Productions](https://opencritic.com/outlet/335/the-outerhaven-productions)** - [Scott Adams](https://opencritic.com/critic/8755/scott-adams) - [4 / 5 stars](https://www.theouterhaven.net/2021/11/blue-reflection-second-light-pc-review/)

>Persona meets Sailor Moon and it lands more times than not! Very good game and has an engaging story.

-------------

>Blue Reflection: Second Light is an overall improvement over the first game with regards to story, level design, and visuals, but it does not come without its problems – notably with its combat.

-------------

**[oprainfall](https://opencritic.com/outlet/775/oprainfall)** - [Steve Baltimore](https://opencritic.com/critic/7353/steve-baltimore) - [5 / 5 stars](https://operationrainfall.com/2021/11/08/review-blue-reflection-second-light)

>I have to say, Blue Reflection: Second Light not only meets my expectations, but exceeds them. I spent right around 40 hours with this one and fell in love with all the characters. The stories told here are not only very emotional, but relatable to all of us on a certain level, and that’s something I find very rare in gaming. The graphics and sound design just really drove home how emotional and wonderful this story is. I had a great time with the crafting system, obtaining new items and building facilities to unlock more events with the girls. Gust should really look hard at the combat system they used here. It takes everything I loved about Ryza’s combat and makes it better. Anyone that loved the anime or the previous game should snag this up as soon as possible at the $59.99 price tag. There is a lot here you’re gonna love. If you have never played or experienced anything from this amazing franchise, there is no better time to start than right now. There is nothing else quite like it.

210,"What's a game with excellent ""core gameplay"" but really disappoints in most other aspects?","I am watching the ever-masochistic AdmiralBahroo slog through a ""no walls"" run of the They Are Billions campaign and it got me thinking about that game and how it has an absolutely top-tier core gameplay loop.  The constant and reinforcing pressures of clearing out and expanding into chunks of the map, plopping down buildings to gain resources so you can repeat elsewhere, slowly building up a large enough army to clear the map with enough time to fortify before the final wave... it's just some of the best ""core gameplay"" I've encountered in 20 years of playing RTS, tower-defense, and city-builder type games.  The various difficulty options and varied map types give it a ton of replayability.  True lightning in a bottle and nothing has quite scratched that itch since.  I totally get the draw to keep coming back to it -- the gameplay is just the perfect combination of strategic, stressful, and satisfying.

However, so much of the rest of the game is just so poorly done it is mind-boggling.  

The pathing is a fairly janky and unit control is really lackluster (I haven't played in a while but I remember always having to issue orders to units with the ""patrol"" command since attack-move never seemed to work right).  

The noise mechanic isn't nearly explained well enough (who is louder, a sniper or a soldier?? Nothing in the game tells you!) and takes way too much trial and error to figure out considering that one accidental pull by a harpy or mutant can end your run.

There is a massive disparity in how game-changing/useful/situational/downright pointless the different mayors are, made worse by the fact you only get to choose from two at a time.  The same goes for the units -- I don't think I ever built half of the roster in dozens of hours of playing.  

The writing is just inexplicable... I wasn't expecting Rockstar quality out of a first-time indie studio but my bar was definitely higher than knock-knock jokes and sassy slutty archers.  You can see them going for the Blizzard-esque tongue-in-cheek/self-aware/4th wall writing/voices but it just really falls so flat.

And that's to say nothing of the campaign, which I think I put down and never touched again after I spent 20 minutes in an already extremely tedious and uninteresting ""hero mission"" looking for the last clickable doodad and couldn't find it.

So what other games have excellent core gameplay but just really disappointed elsewhere?"

232,"How I get to revisit, enjoy, and share my favorite video games as a working father of 3","I started doing this when my oldest was 4 and a half years old. 

There just weren't enough hours in the day for me to work my job, tend to the house, raise the kids, and still have time for a good video game session. And so, to be able to go back and ""play through"" my favorite games with my son, I took the premise, story, and action of the game and formed it into a nightly episodic bedtime story.

The first game I did this with was the original Mega Man for the NES. Basic story line and structure, I figured it would be about 12 ""episodes."" 
Each night before bed, we'd do a 10-15 story, often culminating in an epic battle between Rock and one of the robots (told in the ideal order-to-beat).

This relatively simple, short game, which I knew like the back of my hand, was a perfect test for me as an adaptive storyteller, and an exercise for my son as his first ""audio only"" story.  Plus, I had total control of length, specifics of setting, and narrative focus (Dr. Lights intentions with the robots, vs run and shoot everything).

He loved it, I loved it. And since then I've done several others, including:

- Mega Man 2

- Ocarina of Time

- Twilight Princess

- Twisted Metal 

- Teenage Mutant Ninga Turtles: Turtles in Time

- Final Fantasy VII

I offer this as a possible suggestion to spend quality time with your kids, and scratch that nostalgia itch for your favorite classic games.  I've got two more kids that I'll be doing this with once they're about 4 and a half."

If you didn't get to see my post last month, hi my name is Manny Mallea and i've been making a momentum-based slidey-tastic platformer called Sole Iron Tail. After a ton of developing (mostly on the hyper advanced tail rendering ;P), the game is finally launching in 2 days on Steam and Itch.io! [If you browsed /r/SteamDeck recenty, you may have even seen a screeny of the game running on the Steam Deck!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/qndy3g/this_is_crazy_my_own_game_running_on_steam_deck/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

Sole Iron Tail is a momentum-based platformer, inspired by classic games like Sonic and Kirby. In this game, your best tool is your big tail, as you use it to slide through slopes, charge through pumpkin-themed enemies, and beat big bosses, all to help the ""Iron Tail"" look for their family! Through 5 colorful tales, you'll meet, fight?, and maybe befriend some cute characters, who'll narrate the developing story and may hint at where the rest of the Iron Tails went.

292,What's Happening at Comcept?,"Comcept and Keiji Inafune both have gone down in infamy after the release of Might No. 9. And rightfully so if you ask me after they did just about everything wrong during the development of that game all those years ago.

Randomly I was thinking about Comcept and I did a quick google search to see what they have been doing and the answer seems to be nothing. Their last major AAA (or at least high budget) release was ReCore which was co-developed by them and Armature Studio. By all accounts ReCore is a slightly above average, not quite mediocre release, but nothing special either.

After that they released a budget phone game called Dragons & Colonies. It seems to be a decent little tower defense game with an anime kind of esthetic. Not much could be found online about this game, epically in the west because it was never localized outside of Japan. From what little I could find about it though, the game was unpolished and needed improvements, but it could have been a solid game with a bit more work. Regardless it was such down completely under a year after its release.

There is also Red Ash: The Indelible Legend. Red Ash was supposed to be a follow up of some sort to Mega Man Legends. There was a Kickstarter for both this game, and an OVA around the same time as Mighty No. 9. Because Mighty No. 9 was not even finished at the time of these Kickstarters, fans were pretty mad and the game never got funded and the OVA silently released with little fan fair. Keiji Inafune later said that Red Ash will be made because they found a publisher called Fuze Entertainment, a company that I could find nothing about with a simple google search. But after years of silence, and after the failures of almost all their releases other than ReCore, which was not a major success either, Red Ash seems to have been quietly canceled.

In 2017 Level-5 a company that made the likes of Yo-kai Watch, Ni No Kuni, and Professor Layton later acquired Comcept. And it seems like Level-5 kind of just threw away their money by buying them up. The reason is because nothing but their failed phone game Dragons & Colonies was released since Level-5 acquired them.

So it's been since 2016 since anything major has been released, and it's been since 2019 since anything whatsoever has been released at all. Red Ash is all but canceled with the only thing making it not canceled is no official announcement. So I would like to know, what the hell is Comcept even doing? They don't seem to be making any new games, they have made no new announcements for years, and they don't seem to have even been help co-develop any games or anything of that nature either. They supposedly have not shut down or anything either, so what is going on?"

#I. Introduction

Banjo-Kazooie is a favorite among fans of 3D platformers and those who grew up with the Nintendo 64 – it was the second highest rated game in its respective genre on the console (according to Metacritic), as well as the third best-selling, behind only Super Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64. On a console known for its platformers, Mario and Banjo stood head and shoulders above the rest. And while Mario would wait until Nintendo’s next console for his second 3D platform outing, Banjo’s sequel would come just 2.5 years after the original and release on the same hardware as the first game. Banjo-Tooie had big shoes to fill as the follow-up to one of the most beloved N64 3D platformers, and by all accounts, Banjo-Tooie certainly was a bigger and bolder sequel: it featured an adventure 2.5 times longer than the original, with significantly more bosses, characters, cut-scenes, and transformations, as well was much larger worlds and a multiplayer component to boot.

[Banjo-Tooie](https://imgur.com/a/onAIAY7) certainly had the recipe for a better sequel, and it surely sounded better in all the right ways on paper – however, the moment-to-moment gameplay of the original was traded with a more sprawling and complex adventure, fracturing the fanbase’s opinion on the sequel. While it is a slightly contentious sequel, most people would agree it was very ambitious for its time and didn’t play it safe with the much-loved formula of the original, for better or worse. And in spite of some of the grievances some fans may have with Banjo-Tooie, it’s worth noting it was well received by critics all around at the time of its initial release, earning a 90% on Metacritic. 21 years later, Banjo-Tooie still provides a pretty unique experience from anything else on the market today, but it’s not without its shortcomings. I’m going to talk about the various different elements that make up the game – and there are a ton of different elements in Banjo-Tooie even by modern standards – where they succeed, fail, and in what ways they could be better.

#II. Characters and Soundtrack

**Characters**

Banjo-Tooie is more about the characters and the segmented stories found within the various worlds, rather than the simple revenge plot that mostly takes a backseat after the beginning, up until the end. I like that you can see more of the world that branches off from the first game – the Jinjo Village and Bottles’ house namely. Klungo is also given more characterization this time around and even a funny character arc – he turns out to be more than just the obedient servant we saw him as in the original. It is a little disappointing that Grunty gives up the rhyming for this game, since it was one of her most memorable personality traits in Banjo-Kazooie. The sequel doesn’t have the same fairy tale-type story as the original, so Grunty’s character shifts a little to fit in with the new script.

[Banjo-Tooie’s worlds are filled with a colorful cast of characters:](https://imgur.com/a/V7EsaFy) they’re equal parts funny, helpful, animated, and fit in with the world around them. There are far more character interactions than the first game, with more visual gags to accompany them: Jamjars (move-tutor) occasionally bonking his head when jumping back into his silo, Old King Coal continuing to talk smack after getting his arms blown off by the duo, Big Al coughing and sneezing on the burgers he gives to customers, etc. The characters show a lot of personality in just a few lines and animations, and this quality is a noticeable improvement over Banjo-Kazooie (although Banjo-Kazooie was still great in this regard).

Characters are integrated into the world with respect to both narrative and gameplay cohesion: they’re not only great sources for humor, but they also help with subtle clues and react to changes in the world that directly impact them. Take Jolly Roger, for example: if you visit him in his tavern, he will appear downtrodden and reveal to the duo that his partner was swallowed by a fish. When you pass a larger than normal fish in the lagoon, remembering Jolly’s dialogue will clue you in to this fish being a point of interest. After rescuing his partner from the fish, you will see them both dancing in the tavern in celebration of being reunited. Another memorable moment is seeing Mrs. Boggy and her children back home in Hailfire Peaks with Mr. Boggy, but only if you first returned all her kids to her in Witchyworld.

**Soundtrack**

The soundtrack is every bit as good as the original game’s, though Banjo-Tooie isn’t just more of the same: there’s a lot more dark and brooding tunes, though you still get a lot of the upbeat, carefree jingles seen in the original. The music is also dynamic, with variations in the tracks depending on what part of the world you’re in. Take Jolly Roger’s Lagoon, for example: [this is the main track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad0wbpQPuHs&list=PL9D5D10375437CCA1&index=73) in the town square, [this variation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI-FkierpXM&list=PL9D5D10375437CCA1&index=74) plays when in one of the shops, [this variation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubh4RblgSJ8&list=PL9D5D10375437CCA1&index=76)  plays when underwater, and [this variation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AaP1H8Y9Y&list=PL9D5D10375437CCA1&index=72) of the main hub’s track plays when near the world’s entrance. In addition, Jolly Roger’s Lagoon also has several more tracks for different areas of the world, including two variations of the Flying Saucer track and the Seaweed Temple track. It’s really impressive just how much music was composed for the game and how good it is, with a total of 159 tracks (including variations).

#III. Level Design

**General Game Structure**

Like the first game, Banjo-Tooie focuses on collecting as its main method of progression. However, the actual number of collectibles has been vastly reduced when compared to the first: notes have gone from 100 per world to 16 (15x5 and 1x20), the currency for transformations have literally been reduced tenfold (1 Glowbo for every transformation compared to 5-25 Mumbo Tokens), eggs and red feathers come in packs of 20 instead of 1, etc. Given the vastly increased size of the worlds, this seems like a good move made by the team to avoid frustration from having to cover every inch of a very large map – I always respect when developers are willing to relook at mechanics from the first game and rework it to fit the new one. While the number of collectibles has been reduced in the sequel, the jiggies themselves require a lot more process to collect – they are very rarely out in the open like how they are in the first game.

Jiggies can sometimes span across an entire world – and ocassionally multiple worlds. Take the jiggy in the train station on the icy side of Hailfire Peaks, for example. To access it, you’ll need to trigger the two train switches (one on the lava side and one on the icy side), free Gobi from his cage in Witchyworld, take the train to the lava side of Hailfire Peaks, [ground pound Gobi so he spits his reserve of water to cool the train down,](https://imgur.com/a/THGgsPO) which will finally allow you to take the train to the icy side of Hailfire Peaks to collect the jiggy. It is rewarding to see all the pieces come together – like a jigsaw puzzle, or a “jiggy” if you will. It may sound like a long and drawn-out process when explained step by step, but you’ll likely have already completed some of these steps just through organic exploration of the world: you might’ve already freed Gobi when first exploring Witchyworld, triggered the lava side train switch when exploring the colosseum in Hailfire Peaks, and/or taken the train into the lava side of Hailfire Peaks, before even knowing anything about the jiggy in the train station on the icy side of Hailfire Peaks.

There are sometimes multiple ways to approach a situation. For example, there are these stationary squids in Jolly Roger’s Lagoon holding notes, which can be obtained by either using Kazooie’s talon torpedo ability, or by firing fire eggs in their eyes to get them to stop moving their tentacles. Another example from the same world: there’s a jiggy in Smuggler’s Den that can be obtained via Kazooie’s flight ability or by use of a clockwork egg – and Smuggler’s Den itself can be accessed in two different ways: through the town square or through the lagoon. To tack on one more example: the boss of this world can be fought with the duo as you’d expect, or by use of the world’s submarine transformation, which lends itself to an easier fight. I wouldn’t say the game is filled with moments like this, but there’s enough of them to make thinking outside the box and replays more engaging.

**Interconnectedness and Navigation**

Adding further to the more complex level design, worlds are also intricately linked together – take Grunty Industries as an example, which is made up of a five story factory and a smaller outdoor area – in order to allow the washing machine transformation to make his way over to one of the rabbits with dirty clothes to clean, the duo first has to use Kazooie’s bill drill ability to unscrew the bolts of a platform on floor 2, which will then have it fall from the ceiling to the ground on floor 1. Despite some of the grievances fans have with Grunty Industries, the way it’s all linked together is brilliant: once you have everything in the right place, floor 1 can be accessed from the outside through the main entryway, a broken window, a fire exit, or by train. If you’re on floor 2, you can take the warp pad to get to floor 1, or you can fall through a vent or climb down via the elevator shaft. Flying outside the exterior of the factory is particularly cool after having navigated through the interior of the factory – you realize the factory isn’t just a shell, but a fully realized and explorable building with many entryways and exits.

The increased size of the worlds generally makes navigation more difficult, though you’ll get lost in some worlds more than others. Witchyworld is fairly easy to navigate: [there’s a large tent (the Big Top) centered in the middle of the stage, with various attractions leading to and from it.](https://imgur.com/a/AyqkQhE) If you walk in a circle around the Big Top, you’ll see most of the world’s different avenues: the world entrance, the Space Zone, the Haunted Zone, the Wild West Zone, and Area 51. Each of these areas have different sub-sections so you’ll still occasionally get lost, but it’s just the right amount. Contrast this with Terrydactyland, which is the largest world in terms of scope and has a lot of empty space. It also has a lot of different alcoves with little to no visual distinction on the outside – since the alcoves don’t load the sub-area until you’ve actually entered them, it would’ve helped a ton with navigation to have some visual marker above it before entering. 

In terms of navigation, the other six worlds come somewhere in between Witchyworld and Terrydactyland, though there are warp pads, a good number of flight pads, and a notable number of landmarks in most worlds to assist in navigating these large vistas. Since there’s no map, you do have to have somewhat of an attentive mind when playing Banjo-Tooie: mindlessly going down one path while not taking in your surroundings is going to end with you not knowing what to do a lot more often, in some worlds more than others. Again, Banjo-Tooie is more methodical than its predecessor, for better or worse, but I personally find more “a-ha” moments in Banjo-Tooie because of how intricately linked everything is.

#IV. Flight, Swimming, and FPS Sections

**Flight**

Flight is just as fun as it was in the original game – and in fact, it’s actually more useful to take to the sky in Banjo-Tooie to get a survey of your surroundings, since the worlds are so much larger. Flight can only be triggered via flight pads so as not to break the level design, though you can still use it in unintended ways in a few instances. [It is liberating to take to the sky and freely explore the environments in this way](https://imgur.com/a/OM3nNuW) – soaking in the gorgeous landscapes and seeing these worlds from a new altitude. It was especially novel in 2000, but it’s still appreciable in 2021 even if the scale of these worlds isn’t as impressive as it used to be.

**Swimming**

Swimming sections in games are typically met with hostility – some of the harder and slower parts of Banjo-Kazooie took place underwater after all. It’s great then that the one world with a significant water portion, Jolly Roger’s Lagoon, is actually quite fun – the duo’s movement speed underwater has been increased (particularly if you unlock a secret move), and Mumbo’s enchantment does away with the typical slowly-creeping drowning life-bar. This makes the underwater exploration more in tune with how it is on land. Although the duo’s move-set is limited by comparison, it’s still a fun deviation since it only makes up a small portion of the game.

**FPS Sections**

Both these parts suffer a bit when you have to enter first person mode to aim eggs at a target – since movement and your aiming reticle are both tied to the primary analog stick, the controls feel unwieldy. It works in small doses when precision isn’t as important – aiming at a non-threatening big fish to knock out its teeth is fine, but fighting a boss with these controls is just frustrating. A lot of the weakest moments of the game are tied to these sections, in particular the gauntlets that have you use Kazooie as a gun – (1.) the rooms all look very samey, (2.) 2/3 of the gauntlets are time-based, and (3.) the goal is to visit nearly every room and eliminate the threat – which acts as more of a collectible than a threat – rather than engage in typical FPS action. This would be fine if not for the first two issues.

#V. Character Switches

**Banjo’s & Kazooie’s Split-up Ability**

The duo’s split abilities actually function quite differently than the duo does together, and they’re the best alternate forms in the game, as [they’re triggered via split-up pads,](https://imgur.com/a/Yu0l61M) which are usually near places you would need them. Their moves also make sense to their characters – Banjo can do a variety of things with his backpack like stuffing other characters and objects inside. Kazooie mostly gets added mobility, but even this is used in creative ways, like jumping higher without the weight of Banjo to reach places the duo couldn’t get to together. Banjo’s new moves are more creative, but Kazooie’s increased speed and mobility makes her more fun to control. Switching between characters for specific puzzles is also quick and snappy, as switch clouds are usually near points of interest.

**Humba Wumba’s World-Specific Transformations**

Humba’s transformations are varying levels of interesting depending on the world – some are implemented better than others. Contrast the snowball in Hailfire Peaks with the T-Rex in Terrydactyland, for example: the snowball can organically grow in size by gathering snow to trigger large switches, or shrink by taking damage to squeeze into small places and jump higher. The T-Rex can also grow in size, but this is done by enlarging and shrinking Humba’s hut with Mumbo – a much more drawn-out and laborious process that requires switching between several characters. Another one I liked – despite not being a cool-looking transformation like the T-Rex (oddly one of my least favorite transformations) – is the washing machine in Grunty Industries, since it navigates the environment differently than the duo, and the duo has to put the pieces in place for it to reach different parts of the environment.

**Controlling Mumbo Jumbo**

The worst of these character switches is Mumbo – he’s doesn’t navigate the environment any differently than the duo, and your sole mission in playing in him each time is to press the action button on a Mumbo Pad to trigger a sequence of events that puts you one step closer to a jiggy. Compare Mumbo to Humba’s transformation in the first world: a stony (a walking statue). The stony can talk to other statues and decipher words the duo are unable to understand themselves, slip into small spaces, and compete in a mini-game kickball tournament – the stony’s interactions and the way in which he navigates the environment are different than the duo’s. This is just one of the eight transformations performed by Humba (although it is one of the better ones, to be fair) – meanwhile, Mumbo is featured as a playable character throughout the entire game and is still less interesting. The events themselves that follow a Mumbo Pad activation are at least interesting, but actually playing as him is a drag, unfortunately.

**Problems with Humba’s Transformations and Mumbo**

Humba’s transformations and Mumbo can only be accessed via their specific hut in each world, so switching to them isn’t as quick and snappy as splitting up the duo. In addition, switching between characters can only be facilitated when playing as the duo (ergo, you can’t transform into one of Humba’s transformations if you’re playing as Mumbo). I think it would’ve been better if Humba was removed from the game, and Mumbo was instead a playable character that could switch to the world’s transformation (stony, T-Rex, washing machine, snowball, etc.) via a context-sensitive pad, similar to the duo’s split-up pads. It would’ve removed a lot of unnecessary backtracking without much being lost in the process. The various character switches in the game simply introduces too much back-and-forth.

#VI. Bosses

Banjo-Tooie is filled with boss fights: there’s at least one boss per world, three fights with Klungo, and a final boss with Grunty. The fights themselves are a bit hit or miss depending on the boss – the ones that require you to enter first person mode to aim eggs are certainly on the bottom of my list despite having some cool designs, especially with their questionable hitboxes. The biggest offender is unfortunately the final showdown with Grunty – here you have to aim upwards to hit Grunty popping out of the Hag 1, but the reticle always reverts back to its default position if you let go of the C-Pad buttons (N64)/right analog stick (X360), which unfortunately exists in both versions of the game. The other boss fights that fall outside the gimmickier fights are fairly fun, though too many rely on stopping and shooting eggs rather than directly engaging head-on – having more bosses vulnerable to Kazooie’s peck attack would’ve allowed for a better flow of action. 

While the fights themselves are a mixed bag, all the other elements relating to these bosses are great: (1.) the way they’re integrated into the world, (2.) the lead-up to the fight, (3.) their introduction and banter with the duo, (4.) their scale and design, (5.) the reward for defeating them, etc. [Take Terry from Terrydactyland:](https://imgur.com/a/FHlJaML) the actual fight with Terry is just okay, but consider all the other elements: (1.) Terry snaps at the duo and rains mucus on you as you make your way up the mountain; (2.) you fight in his nest, high atop a mountain; (3.) the introductory cut-scene heightens Terry’s scale over the duo; (4.) the banter between Terry and the duo before the fight lends both humor and personality to Terry; (5.) Terry’s defeat gives the duo use of a flight pad to navigate the world, as well as granting Kazooie the ability to hatch Terry’s eggs. Jiggies are always a nice reward, but gaining the ability to fly in the outdoor portion of Terrydactyland allows you to navigate the environment in a new way. 

While not every boss possesses all of these qualities, all of the bosses have at least most of them, on top of some them having genuinely enjoyable fights. The dragon duo in Hailfire Peaks is another noteworthy example that possesses all these elements: Chilli Billi and Chilly Willy rain fireballs and iceballs down on their respective halves of Hailfire Peaks (the fire and ice world) throughout your exploration of the world – after making your way to the top of their mountains where they reside and defeating them however, this stops permanently on their respective half. It’s rare to see your actions have a permanent effect on the world itself in any 3D platformer, let alone one from 21 years ago.

#VII. Technical Performance and Multiplayer and Other Elements

**Technical Performance**

The Xbox 360 version is definitely the best way to play the game today: graphics and resolution have been improved, rumble support is built into the controller, Stop ‘N’ Swap has been added, a checklist of jiggies for each world has been implemented, and most importantly, the frame-rate has been improved. That last one is especially important because the original N64 version is severely hampered by its subpar performance in this area. There are [frame-rate fixes for the N64 version of the game on emulators,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAfTef6UiSw) available, but I can’t speak to them. Unfortunately, it seems the draw distance hasn’t been touched going from the N64 to the X360, which is especially disappointing given that they vastly improved it in the X360 port of the original game. It doesn’t cause too many problems, but playing the first game on X360 and seeing the improvement in this area makes it more noticeable when playing Banjo-Tooie.

**Multiplayer and Other Elements**

Banjo-Tooie introduced a separate multiplayer mode, in which players could compete against each other in the various mini-games from the single player campaign, as well as the quiz show and the FPS gauntlets. Ironically, the FPS sections probably have the most longevity in the multiplayer mode despite them being a huge annoyance in the campaign. The other mini-games are okay, but since most are a minute or less they won’t entertain for too long. The other added features are cool too: you can copy profiles, replay boss fights, and rewatch cut-scenes – these are appreciated additions that weren’t in the original. The X360 version also feature online leaderboards, which is good for those who like to speedrun games.

#VIII. Closing

[Banjo-Tooie](https://imgur.com/a/neqblqT) is a well-crafted adventure that feels one in its own: it retains the formula of the original without being a mere retread with a new coat of paint. It expands on the concepts of the first game while introducing plenty of new ideas of its own – some of which are better than others. It certainly makes some mistakes in its effort to be a bigger, better, and bolder sequel than its predecessor – its insistence on FPS sections and backtracking, and a poor frame-rate in the original version – but it also hits a lot of high notes: characters are more animated and livelier than in the original, the worlds are interconnected and experience meaningful changes based on player actions, and the more elaborate methods of collecting jiggies leads to more “a-ha” moments. I’d love for a proper remake to iron out its shortcomings so its qualities can be appreciated by more people, but what’s here is still a lot of fun 21 years later.

#Too Long; Didn’t Read Section

This was a long one, so I appreciate anyone who took the time to read it. I’m going to post a tl;dr below for those who’d prefer to read something shorter.

**I. Introduction**

* Banjo-Tooie is the sequel to one of the best-selling and most critically acclaimed N64 3D platformers. It expanded on the original formula and massively increased the scope of the game. However, the moment-to-moment gameplay suffers when compared to the original, and the backtracking and ability-gating is contentious among fans of the first game.

**II. Characters and Soundtrack**

* **Characters:** Characters really come to life in Banjo-Tooie: they interact with their environment, provide useful tips to the duo, are seamlessly integrated into the world, and are great sources of humor.

* **Soundtrack:** The soundtrack is excellent, featuring a lot of the same upbeat jingles as the original along with a darker arrangement of tracks. Many different variations play depending on what part of the world you’re in.

**III. Level Design**

* **General Game Structure:** Jiggies require much more process to collect and are frequently gated by your available move-set at the time. There’s much more process to collecting them, but generally more “a-ha” moments than in the first game, and also more alternative methods for collecting.

* **Interconnectedness and Navigation:** The process of collecting a jiggy can sometimes take place across an entire world and occasionally multiple worlds. The worlds are more difficult to navigate than in the first game due to their increased size, and there are some instances where downsizing certain areas or adding more visual markers would’ve helped with navigation. However, the plentiful warp pads, flight pads, and landmarks aid in this exploration, and generally I feel it does a good job in making exploration fun in spite of a few hiccups, particularly in Terrydactyland and Grunty Industries.

**IV. Flight, Swimming, and FPS Sections**

* **Flight:** Flight is a lot of fun and allows you to take in the worlds from a new altitude – it controls well and allows you to navigate the environment in a new way.

* **Swimming:** Banjo-Tooie’s one major world with a significant water portion does away with the slowly-creeping drowning life-bar that pervades so many other games, to make underwater exploration more akin to how it is on land, albeit with much fewer moves.

* **FPS Sections:** The FPS controls are wonky and are too pervasive throughout the course of the game – making their way into mini-games, flight, underwater, and boss sections. They work in small doses where threats aren’t imminent, but generally the FPS sections are some of the weakest moments of the game.

**V. Character Switches**

* **Banjo’s and Kazooie’s Split-up Ability:** Banjo’s and Kazooie’s split abilities are great – they’re triggered via a split-up pad in places you would usually need them and their unique abilities make sense to their characters, allowing Banjo to use his backpack for new purposes and granting Kazooie added mobility.

* **Humba Wumba’s World-Specific Transformations:** Humba’s eight transformations are a mixed bag, with some being better than others. One of the more creative ones is the snowball, which allows you to organically grow by rolling in snow to trigger large switches, and shrink by taking damage, to fit into small spaces.

* **Controlling Mumbo Jumbo:** Playing as Mumbo is unfortunately a bit of a letdown, as he does little more than press a corresponding button on his context-sensitive pad, acting as a middle piece in a sequence of events, rather than a fun character that navigates the environment in a new way.

* **Problems with Humba’s Transformations and Mumbo:** Humba’s transformations and playing as Mumbo introduces too much backtracking – I would’ve preferred to play as Mumbo and activate transformations via a context-sensitive pad similar to the duo’s split-up pad, and have Humba removed from the game.

**VI. Bosses**

* Boss fights are a mixed bag due to a number of them utilizing FPS controls, but all the other elements that make up the bosses themselves are great: (1.) the way they’re integrated into the world, (2.) the lead-up to the fight, (3.) their introduction and banter with the duo, (4.) their scale and design, (5.) the reward for defeating them, etc.

**VII. Technical Performance and Multiplayer and Other Elements**

* **Technical Performance:** The frame-rate is probably the objectively worst element of the original N64 version – fortunately it runs at a stable 30fps in the X360 version of the game and is the recommended version for this reason as well as other quality of life enhancements.

* **Multiplayer and Other Elements:** The game features a mini-games taken from the single player campaign repurposed for multiplayer, as well as the ability to replay/rewatch boss fights and cut-scenes, copy files, and online leaderboards in the X360 version.

**VIII. Closing**

* Banjo-Tooie is a lot of fun even today. Banjo-Kazooie may be the “safer” recommendation, but it’s admirable that the development team decided to challenge themselves with a more ambitious project, even if the results are mixed in some places. That said, Banjo-Tooie scores more than it misses, and I’d wholeheartedly recommend it."

>Coming up in the next and final part of our review, we’ll have more insight into preparing enclosures for marine dinosaurs, genetic modification, and sandbox mode! Sandbox mode really is like an entirely different game since you have access to so many more decorative and theme-park-related features right out the gate, so we’re thrilled to see what we can do with those assets. I also just learned that you can press  Shift + C to take some incredible screenshots…so expect some dynamic shots of my dinosaurs being lazy next time.

>Whether you're a seasoned Jurassic World Evolution player or brand new to the franchise, I can guarantee you that you will have a blast with Jurassic World Evolution 2. While I think a couple of things could be tweaked to make certain things more obvious, it doesn't stop you from having an absolutely wonderful time playing the game. The addition of the flying and aquatic dinosaurs has been excellent, and I really hope for more content and DLC to go along with it!

>Improves on its predecessor in clever ways and still boasts the most gorgeous dinosaurs ever made in a game. But dealing with disastrous events beyond your control still isn't any fun, even if it's thematic for the Jurassic Park IP.

>The message of the movies is that you can’t control nature, but Jurassic World Evolution 2 hits back by saying, “We’ll let you try anyway.” And I succeeded numerous times over nearly 20 hours with this park builder. Jurassic World Evolution 2 let me correct the sins of the past by corralling loose dinosaurs and building one of the most famous movie settings in history. And it let me do it my way while also making me feel like I’d succeeded where others failed.

**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [John Cal McCormick](https://opencritic.com/critic/1932/john-cal-mccormick) - [8 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/jurassic-world-evolution-2)

>If we had to make a list of things that are totally radical then dinosaurs chasing and eating annoying fannypack-wearing tourists while we triumphantly hum the Jurassic Park theme tune would be top ten. Maybe even top five. We're here for that. Minor quibbles with the main campaign aside, Jurassic World Evolution 2 delivers an entertaining if simplistic park builder, that well-utilises the Jurassic World license, and throws in just the right amount of dinosaur-fuelled mayhem to boot.

-------------

**[TheGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/731/thegamer)** - [Helen Ashcroft](https://opencritic.com/critic/6735/helen-ashcroft) - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.thegamer.com/jurassic-world-evolution-2-review-pc/)

>Overall, Jurassic Park Evolution 2 delivers improvements across the board. It takes the best parts of the original game, adds new ways to play, and changes up mechanics to make them feel more realistic and interesting - making everything more engaging and immersive. Building straight paths and fences is easier, keeping dinosaurs fed is a breeze, and even speeding up time is now possible, yet managing those raptors is still a welcome challenge. While I may not actually be the best dinosaur supervisor yet, I can’t see myself putting this game down for a long time.

-------------

**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Dominic Leighton](https://opencritic.com/critic/307/dominic-leighton) - [9 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?p=388697)

>Jurassic World Evolution 2 is bigger, better, and bolder, and smooths off some of the original's rough edges. Frontier has tinkered with the management sim aspects, and brought in a canonical campaign into the mix that follows directly on from the events in Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom, but the dinosaurs remain the star of the show. If you're a fan of the franchise – and really, who doesn't love uncontrollable carnivores? – then Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a perfect sequel.

>All in all, Call of Duty: Vanguard is a solid yet unremarkable entry into the long-running franchise. On a technical level, it's one of the most impressive games out there right now. On a gameplay level, it's nothing you haven't seen before.

-------------

**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Trevor Houston](https://opencritic.com/critic/809/trevor-houston) - [84 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/call-duty-vanguard-review/)

>Vanguard doesn’t stray too far away from the classic Call of Duty formula we have come to expect from the franchise over the past several years. In many ways, it’s a little more of the same. That said, Call of Duty: Vanguard is an incredibly robust package offering up tons of content for the buck. Zombies mode is far more enjoyable and varied, the single-player campaign is a visual stunner, and 20 MP maps at launch is nothing to sneeze at. If you have passed over Call of Duty over the last several years, it might be time to come back.

-------------

**[Digital Chumps](https://opencritic.com/outlet/96/digital-chumps)** - [Ben Sheene](https://opencritic.com/critic/5312/ben-sheene) - [9.5 / 10](https://digitalchumps.com/call-of-duty-vanguard-review)

>Call of Duty: Vanguard continues the high standard set by 2019's Modern Warfare, providing a grounded, classic Call of Duty campaign, coupled with a deep multiplayer experience rich with progression and an inviting Zombies mode that welcomes all skill levels.

-------------

**[Eurogamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer)** - [Wesley Yin-Poole](https://opencritic.com/critic/780/wesley-yin-poole) - [No Recommendation / Blank](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-11-05-call-of-duty-vanguard-review-fun-filler-that-wont-live-long-in-the-memory)

>Vanguard won't join the pantheon of Call of Duty games, but it's a decent stop-gap for those waiting for Modern Warfare's return.

-------------

**[Filmweb](https://opencritic.com/outlet/781/filmweb)** - [Michał Walkiewicz](https://opencritic.com/critic/7399/micha-walkiewicz) - *Polish* - [8 / 10 stars](https://www.filmweb.pl/reviews/recenzja-gry-Call+of+Duty%3A+Vanguard-24070)

>If gaming industry was a family reunion, Rockstar would be unbearable neoliberal patriarch. Hideo Kojima would go as a pretentious cousin with film school diploma and degree in philosophy. „Call of Duty: Vanguard” on the other hand would be a heavy-drinking, wisecracking, jovial uncle who reminisces good ol’ war times, tells dad jokes and eventually makes a flatus ignition show with his zippo. It’s good to talk about virtues of art and have strong pacifistic beliefs. But parties without uncle are just boring.

-------------

**[Game Informer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/35/game-informer)** - [Daniel Tack](https://opencritic.com/critic/1031/daniel-tack) - [8 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/call-of-duty-vanguard/call-of-duty-vanguard-review-a-tumultuous-trinity)

>Vanguard is an overall solid pick with a lackluster campaign, a nascent but incredibly promising zombies experience, and multiplayer with a few critical new aspects.

-------------

**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Phil Hornshaw](https://opencritic.com/critic/641/phil-hornshaw) - [7 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-vanguard-review-personnel-problems/1900-6417780/)

>Tweaks in multiplayer and Zombies advance the Call of Duty franchise overall, and an emphasis on distinct characters makes Vanguard's story fun, but it doesn't always mix well with the series' gameplay.

-------------

**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - [Rami Bououd](https://opencritic.com/critic/5002/rami-bououd) - *French* - [7 / 10](https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-de-call-of-duty-vanguard-un-bon-cru-ou-un-opus-timide-389995)

>Call of Duty Vanguard isn't the part of the revolution, but clearly does the job, offering a title that will hold up for the year ahead.

-------------

**[GamesBeat](https://opencritic.com/outlet/78/gamesbeat)** - [Dean Takahashi](https://opencritic.com/critic/1046/dean-takahashi) - [Unscored](https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/04/call-of-duty-vanguard-review-impressions-aligning-history-narrative-and-gameplay/)

>Call of Duty: Vanguard is a balanced game across the vectors of historical interest, good gameplay, variety, and a strong narrative. It ties everything together in a competent way that makes sense. That doesn’t mean it’s a spectacular game on the order of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which was a breakthrough game for the franchise because of its thoughtfulness and disturbing material. This is a good installment, but the stutter in combat makes me wonder if it’s as polished as it should be.

-------------

**[GamingTrend](https://opencritic.com/outlet/102/gamingtrend)** - [David Burdette](https://opencritic.com/critic/7590/david-burdette) - [90 / 100](https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/call-of-duty-vanguard-review-old-soldiers-never-die/)

>This culmination of all things Call Of Duty has resulted in something the entire series can look to, a blueprint on how to build a meaty and superb first person shooter experience.

-------------

**[Hardcore Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/23/hardcore-gamer)** - [Kevin Dunsmore](https://opencritic.com/critic/892/kevin-dunsmore) - [4 / 5](https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=413776)

>Sledgehammer Games clearly had high ambitions when approaching their third solo Call of Duty project.

-------------

**[Hobby Consolas](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas)** - [David Martinez](https://opencritic.com/critic/2884/david-martinez) - *Spanish* - [87 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/call-duty-vanguard-analisis-fps-ambientado-segunda-guerra-mundial-955099)

>Even failing at ""showing World Wart Two like never before"", Call of Duty Vanguard is a great FPS. Campaign is full of epic (and some dramatic) moments, multiplayer is fun and fast, and includes 16 maps (twice as the previous Call of Duty game) with plenty of modes and progression elements, and the new zombies mode is incredibly fun.

-------------

**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Simon Cardy](https://opencritic.com/critic/5521/simon-cardy) - [7 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-vanguard-single-player-campaign-review)

>Call of Duty Vanguard's highly polished campaign provides a healthy amount of fun, even if its brief length and lack of variety lead it to fall short of the classic pieces of war cinema it's trying to emulate.
>
>[OpenCritic note: IGN is separately reviewing the campaign, multiplayer, and zombies modes. Their scores will be combined when finalized.]

>Opting for pulp fantasy over Spielbergian reverence for the era, Vanguard reinvigorates the World War II setting and charts a new path forward.

**[TrueGaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/449/truegaming)** - *Arabic* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.true-gaming.net/home/472243/call-of-duty-vanguard/)

>Call of Duty: Vanguard offers us a mix of interesting stories, very fun group play phases and much-welcomed zombie innovations, already an experience not to be missed for fans of the series and first-perspective shooting games.

>At a superficial glance Football Manager 2022 might seem like little more than just an update: the new chapter of Sports Interactive's football management simulation is much more. That one is delivered to the annals is probably not the best Football Manager in the thirty-year history of the series, but a good episode yes.

-------------

>All in all, Football Manager 2022 is another sublime sports simulation. It once again proves that you can enjoy football games without directly controlling the players. Its new additions add to an experience already brimming with depth, and the refinement of the gameplay style means that you’ll struggle not to lose yourself within Sports Interactive’s digital training ground. Its proficiency on even the oldest of hardware means there’s really no excuse not to dive in. This is Football Manager at its best, the virtual equivalent of a top-corner goal.

>Football Manager 2022 is a chapter of consolidation, which capitalizes on last year's revolution. Sports Interactive has worked hard to improve the game engine even more, with brilliant animations and a brand new AI, which has a strong impact on certain game situations, such as pressing and occupying half spaces. The introduction of the Data Hub and small changes to the interface makes Football Manager 2022 the umpteenth excellent chapter of the series, which for the occasion also lands on Xbox Game Pass.

>Over the years I've had a love/hate relationship with Football Manager. Some years I can't put it down, others I can barely make it through a season. Football Manager 2022 is a cracking entry in the series and has added plenty to make it feel fresh when compared to previous years, the data hub being the cream of the crop.

>‎Visually very original, playably very familiar and narratively very interesting are the adjectives that join AAA production values to put on the table one of the best RPGs of the year and, possibly, of the decade.‎

>Although it's been a while since the last mainline game, Shin Megami Tensei V lives up to the hype. This is a JRPG you won't want to miss.

**[CGMagazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/82/cgmagazine)** - [Zubi Khan](https://opencritic.com/critic/4059/zubi-khan) - [9 / 10](https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/shin-megami-tensei-v-review/)

>Shin Megami Tensei V is an excellent Switch exclusive worthy of its name, with the game feeling like the natural next step in the long-running series while introducing new elements that elevate it above even its contemporaries while not straying too far from its roots, offering fans a must-play experience and for everyone else, a JRPG worth jumping into.

**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Nicola Kapron](https://opencritic.com/critic/7880/nicola-kapron) - [90 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/shin-megami-tensei-v-review/)

>Shin Megami Tensei V is an incredible achievement. While it comes off as less of a horror game than previous entries in the series, its sheer scale and eerie presentation more than make up for the lack of dedicated scares. In some ways, I feel that gaming technology has finally reached the point that it’s able to convey the tone and feel that Shin Megami Tensei has been trying to capture since the 80s. There’s a lot packed into this game, especially if you play on a higher difficulty, which I definitely recommend doing. If you’re allergic to grinding, there is an optional Safety difficulty that will let you focus on the story instead, but you’ll still probably spend a lot of time exploring the expansive game world and getting lost between buildings.

>Shin Megami Tensei V feels like a natural symbiosis from Nocturne and Apocalypse, packs on it a lot of new features and solves some of the problems of the older games. The verticality and collecting are extremly fun, the story is great and offers interesting characters. It only suffers a bit from being exclusive on the Nintendo Switch

>If you like weird, deep, engaging and often challenging tactical combat, Shin Megami Tensei V is a devilishly good time that offers plenty to sink your teeth into.

>The seemingly endless possibilities of Shin Megami Tensei V directly fueled my desire to play it from the moment I got my copy. It’s overwhelming, but compartmentalized. The world is technically finite, but feels limitless. It’s just what a lot of people want out of an RPG, and the strong personality-driven throughput helps propel it past a lot of its competition.

>I’ve still got more to get through before I’ve finished the story, so for now, I’m not quite ready to give a score just yet. What I can say for now is that Shin Megami Tensei V is one hell of a game. No, I don’t love everything about it. And sure, it’s hard not to see it as a soft reboot of Nocturne on some level. But, more than any of that, it’s a sign that the Atlus I once came to love does still exist, and—more importantly—isn’t ready to soften the rough edges of the Shin Megami Tensei series just yet.

>Shin Megami Tensei V is both an evolution and a twist in the formula that has made the Atlus saga famous all over the world. From the point of view of the combat system, it introduces new mechanics such as Magatsuhi Abilities and Essences, which complete a harmonious mosaic and give some of the most memorable boss fights ever.

>I have now spent over 50 hours playing Shin Megami Tensei V — a game that I adore, but also one with a few faults. This RPG on the Nintendo Switch will bind you in its tangled, storied web of angels versus demons, of power struggles to see who will take the Throne of God, but the web is marred by some unfortunate navigation and technical issues.

>While Shin Megami Tensei 5 is rough around the edges, fans of the series will be satisfied. However, newcomers and those not impressed by the previous entries best approach with caution.

-------------

**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Pramath - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/shin-megami-tensei-v-review)

>A staggering scope of ambition paired with a frankly absurd amount of mechanical depth make Shin Megami Tensei 5 one of the most impressive role playing games ever, and a must play for any and all fans of the genre.

>Shin Megami Tensei V is a masterfully made JRPG and fascinating work of art. While the characters could have used more fleshing out and the leveling curve is wildly uneven, it's still incredibly fun with thrilling combat and a gripping plot.

>It’s not a stretch to say that Shin Megami Tensei V has set a new standard for JRPGs. It’s amazing to see how far along this series has come since the initial inception of Megami Tensei, and the fact that ATLUS can continue to improve the series without compromising its core features. Shin Megami Tensei V has been a long time coming, but the wait has absolutely been worth it—and I’m more excited than ever to watch the SMT franchise continue to grow.

>Shin Megami Tensei V trascends divinity achieving a perfect balance between heaven and hell: it's and ode to the classics, to those JRPG's that weren't afraid of being complex and challenging, but it's also a modern game, adapted to current times and trends..

-------------

**[Infinite Start](https://opencritic.com/outlet/825/infinite-start)** - [9.5 / 10](https://infinitestart.com/2021/11/shin-megami-tensei-v-review/)

>Shin Megami Tensei V is the Shin Megami Tensei game fans have been waiting for. Not only it does improve the core gameplay, but it also offers a dark-gritty storyline that exceeds previous efforts. There is so much to do in Shin Megami Tensei V that could make you easily forget how long you’ve been playing. If you have been a fan of the SMT games, Shin Megami Tensei V is a must-buy, and for JRPG gamers, it is a game you don’t want to miss.

>Shin Megami Tensei V on Nintendo Switch retains all the strategic combat elements the Atlus franchise is known for, all while radically revolutionizing its world design to create an adventure that is completely addicting and flawlessly complements the battle system. It's a truly remarkable achievement. In fact, while some people think SMT should borrow more from its spinoff Persona franchise, Shin Megami Tensei V makes me wonder if maybe Persona could learn a thing or two from its older brother.

-------------

**[Nintendo Life](https://opencritic.com/outlet/136/nintendo-life)** - [Mitch Vogel](https://opencritic.com/critic/924/mitch-vogel) - [9 / 10](http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/shin-megami-tensei-v)

>Shin Megami Tensei V is a modern masterpiece. It successfully delivers on all the aspects that have made the series thus far so popular with fans-namely through its high difficulty, heavy narrative themes, and expansive team-building options-while polishing up and tightening the weaker aspects. Things like a more easily navigable map and more difficulty options to cater to players of all skill levels comfortably make this the most approachable entry in the series, and it feels like there's more things to do in the world than ever before. If you are at all a fan of RPGs or have been looking for a good entry point into this oft overlooked series, we would strongly encourage you to pick this up as soon as you can. Shin Megami Tensei V was worth the wait, Atlus has successfully stuck the landing with this one.

>Shin Megami Tensei V succeeds in not just living up to that legacy, but being a glorious RPG in its own right.

>Now that we've finally closed the book on the 2017 Switch presentation, I think Shin Megami Tensei V might be my favourite game to emerge from that show. That's not a comparison I make lightly given the other games that appeared that night, but for my money and time it was worth the wait. Pokemon might be ending the year of RPGs on Switch, but SMT V is the best monster catcher for your buck yet.

>There are more quality-of-life updates that go beyond combat. While roaming through areas, you will now stumble upon orbs that can recharge your health, SP (mana for magic attacks), or Magatsuhi gauge. The return pillar allows you to return to the last checkpoint you interacted with on a whim without any penalization (perfect to save your game, restore health to your party for a small fee, visit the merchant, or fuse demons). Loot is fairly generous as well; a companion character who follows you around pinpoints item spots that sometimes lead to fights, but more often than not just grants you an item.

>The Shin Megami Tensei games have often been some of the most mechanically inventive and unique, and that remains the case with SMT5. Combat is challenges and dynamic, and the party-building options are limitless. My only issues with the game boiled down to JRPG tropes that likely won’t bother hardcore fans. It’s not only an excellent JRPG, but a wonderful new entry in one of the genre’s most influential games.

>Shin Megami Tensei V is an incredible and memorable experience. It does some extraordinary things, both in terms of gameplay and its story. I’d even say the experience could be daunting, but in the most positive way. It is going to test you and make you think.

>Shin Megami Tensei successfully builds over the third entry in the franchise, upping the ante with a great combat system and more freedom to explore. One of the best JRPGs in the last few years and a great exclusive for the Nintendo Switch.

>Shin Megami Tensei 5 is a punishing delight. It revels in its classic approach to combat and exploration, brought to life with a battered and broken vision of our world as it teeters on the edge of extinction. JRPGs of the modern era are often content to hold our hands and guide us through each new journey, but Atlus decides to punch us in the gut, steal our wallet, and sprint away as we try desperately to catch up. As I’ve said time and time again, this isn’t a game for everyone, but those who gel with its specific brand of masochism will find something very special indeed.

>At the end of the day, I’m not so sure that Shin Megami Tensei V really pushes the envelope forward for the series. It doesn’t have the emotional brevity of the excellent Nocturne, nor does it present the same kind of moral quandaries that IV did. It certainly looks better and plays incredibly well, and from a gameplay perspective, this would easily be the most accessible entry of the bunch.

-------------

**[VG247](https://opencritic.com/outlet/549/vg247)** - [Hirun Cryer](https://opencritic.com/critic/3422/hirun-cryer) - [3 / 5 stars](https://www.vg247.com/shin-megami-tensei-5-review-a-brutal-rpg-that-goes-all-in-on-battles-of-attrition)

>Shin Megami Tensei 5’s combat is great, punishing and rewarding in equal measure without ever tipping the scales too far in one direction. Mixing and matching your deck of demons makes for great fun as well, and spurs you to look to all corners of the ruined world for allies of all shapes and sizes. It’s everything outside of the battling and grungy soundtrack where Shin Megami Tensei 5 badly misses the mark, with one-note characters that you’re never given the chance to better know, and a paper-thin plot that feels dragged out over dozens of hours. Shin Megami Tensei 5 is a good RPG battler, but it’s not good at much else.

>Featuring a new approach to exploration and extremely solid gameplay, Shin Megami Tensei V masterfully balances innovation and tradition to offer an excellent JRPG experience.  While the technical issues can get in the way, the game's quality is so high that most will be willing to look past them, as Shin Megami Tensei V is one of the best entries in the series and one of the best JRPGs released in 2021.

>It's not winning any awards for graphics, but Shin Megami Tensei V is a well-designed JRPG that has just a little too much combat. Even with such an interesting story and themes to explore, it instead focuses on grinding and fighting the same enemies over and over.

**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [9 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2021/11/4/reviews/129249-switch-review-shin-megami-tensei-v/)

>Shin Megami Tensei V is pretty much the sequel that fans have been waiting for. There are a few potentially controversial decisions, such as the emphasis on an open-world area instead of the franchise classic dungeons, but they ended up working out in the end. The gameplay was fun from start to finish, and the 40-hour runtime seemed to fly by thanks to excellent pacing. If you liked Nocturne but wished it were more modern, SMT5 is the game you've been waiting for.

But if you're already happy with Forza Horizon 4 or were bored by that one, take your sweet time sitting behind this game's wheel.*|XSX, PC|

It’s the difference between opportunities and obligations. The only area in which Forza Horizon 5 stumbles is when it gives me so much of the former that they become the latter.*||

As impossible it may seem in the moment that it will be surpassed, however, if history has taught us anything, it’s that this is a series that never stops improving.*|XSX|

Whether it’s the thrill of the race, tools for encouraging creativity, or uninhibited exploration, there’s something for everyone to do and participate in this evolving open-world. While the core formula is unchanged over the years and it’s a lot more of the same – the same is really good. This is a multiplayer game where you can choose to engage with all or none of its systems at any time. Forza Horizon 5 is an outstanding achievement of gameplay and visuals, and is an exquisite open-world racer for the next-generation.*|XSX, XSS, PC|

I say with absolute confidence: Forza Horizon 5 is the most complete racing game ever made.*||

It’s fun, only structured if you want it to be, and seems to exist purely to make sure you have a good time.*|XSX|
|[**TrueAchievements**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/316/trueachievements) \- [Luke Albiges](https://opencritic.com/critic/7551/luke-albiges)|100 \~ [10 / 10](http://www.trueachievements.com/n47612/forza-horizon-5-review-xbox)|*Beautiful, vast, creative, varied, and exciting, Forza Horizon 5 is an incredible game that will have you hooning around Mexico for months. There's an amazing sense of variety to everything about this game, and the smart Accolades system should have many achievement hunters hooked as they explore the full extent of what this remarkable racer has to offer. Fantastic handling, interesting events, and a wonderful history-spanning selection of cars makes for an amazing experience — arguably the best game in the series to date, and inarguably the best game in the series to DOOT. See you in Mexico, amigos...*|XSX|

Its flawless racing and wealth of activities are backed up by a gorgeous setting and a fantastic new progression system which encourages players to focus on the features they enjoy most. Utterly essential.*|XSX, XSS|

It combines the most beloved parts of Forza Horizon 3 and 4 into one ultimate racer.*|XSX|
|[**PowerUp!**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/577/powerup-) \- [Leo Stevenson](https://opencritic.com/critic/3173/leo-stevenson)|98 \~ [9.8 / 10](https://powerup-gaming.com/2021/11/04/forza-horizon-5-review-xbox-series-x-tengo-que-ir-rapido/)|*You may never stop playing Forza Horizon 5.

It doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it does make it smoother and faster than ever. It is not only one of the best games to release this year, it is a true showcase of just what a “next-gen” title can be.*|XSX|

A joyous combo of arcade racing and simulation-level depth, all wrapped up in a beautiful bow thanks to its diverse, expansive Mexico setting, this is an unmissable iteration in what is arguably gaming’s most consistently fantastic series.*|XSX, PC|
|[**Press Start**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/491/press-start) \- [Brodie Gibbons](https://opencritic.com/critic/3662/brodie-gibbons)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/xbox-series-x-reviews/2021/11/04/forza-horizon-5-review-an-interactive-postcard/)|*Though it's iterative in a lot of ways, Forza Horizon 5 is a near-faultless open-world racing experience that's so sure of itself and its offerings that it goes the extra mile to sprinkle in the kinds of fan service that people go wild for.*||
|[**Wccftech**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/304/wccftech) \- [Chris Wray](https://opencritic.com/critic/1264/chris-wray)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/)|*Forza Horizon 5 is yet another step up for the series and arguably the best racing game ever made. Offering a host of content across a fantastic representation of Mexico, its varied terrain and scenery, there's so much to explore and race. A massive roster of cars will perform all of these, each feeling different from the others, with a variety of upgrade and tuning options almost matching those of simulation titles. While there are a few minor niggles here and there, they are nearly so small as to be hardly worth mentioning. All in all, it's impossible not to recommend this for anybody, regardless of them being a fan of racing games or not, as this is that good.*|PC|

Again.*|XSX, XB1|

Infectiously so, which makes Forza Horizon 5 the most polished entry, in terms of overall structure and presentation, to date.*||
|[**Gadgets 360**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/309/gadgets-360) \- [Akhil Arora](https://opencritic.com/critic/1736/akhil-arora)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/forza-horizon-5-review-xbox-one-x-gameplay-release-date-price-size-pc-game-pass-2599093)|*Playground Games can offer up an iterative experience and rake in the money, because Forza Horizon 5 is in a world of its own.

|[**GameSpew**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/408/gamespew) \- [Richard Seagrave](https://opencritic.com/critic/2754/richard-seagrave)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.gamespew.com/2021/11/forza-horizon-5-review/)|*This is the biggest and best entry in the Forza Horizon series yet; it’s just lacking that spark of originality that has made each entry prior a clear step up from the one before it. But for the huge majority of players, that really won’t be an issue.*|XSX|
|[**GameSpot**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot) \- [Alessandro Barbosa](https://opencritic.com/critic/1228/alessandro-barbosa)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/forza-horizon-5-review-its-about-four-wheeled-family/1900-6417778/)|*Forza Horizon 5 continues the upward trend of the franchise, providing an open-world racing experience that stands unrivaled.*||

Driving feels as good as it ever has and Playground Games absolutely succeeded in interpreting the beauty of Mexico. The seasonal model returns and it does a better job of incentivizing people to group up, but it's still not quite enough to entice people to do activities like Forza Arcade.*|XSX|
|[**PC Gamer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/162/pc-gamer) \- [Phil Savage](https://opencritic.com/critic/718/phil-savage)|90 \~ [90 / 100](https://www.pcgamer.com/forza-horizon-5-review/?utm_campaign=socialflow)|*Playground's singular series gets a lush new setting, but otherwise remains committed to tuning an already winning formula. But even a marginal improvement on the best racing series around is worth celebrating.*|PC|

If you found little value in the series before now, this new version will do nothing to change your mind. For the rest of us, the best Xbox game of 2021 is here (at least for another month - there’s still an elephant wearing Spartan armor in the room). The concept of the pack-in game is pretty much dead in 2021, but if it weren’t, Microsoft should be tripping over itself to make the Series X Forza Bundle a reality. We live in the era of Game Pass now, so plenty of folks have the ability to visit Mexico at discount rates. I desperately implore you to take the trip.*|PC|

Despite these slight niggles it still manages to put a beaming smile on my face every time I go hurtling off a danger sign, masterfully overtake the leader of a race to snatch the victory, or perfect a drift. It’s easily one of the best-looking games on the Xbox Series X, and its extensive roster of cars and events will ensure it’s engine keeps quietly ticking over for months on end. With an abundance of multiplayer options and seasonal content frequently released to offer more rewards for your podium finishes, it’s the biggest and best Forza Horizon game you can play right now. Racing and Forza fans alike start your engines. It’s time for a whole new Horizon festival that you simply can’t miss out on.*|XSX|

By using almost everything that worked in FH4, the game would've been a strong contender even if all it did was change its locale. The few changes in FH5 work heavily in its favor and contribute positively to the idea that the game is difficult to put down because it's fun and there's so much to do. For those who have played previous entries in the series, jump on this one immediately. For series newcomers, FH5 is a perfect place to start.*|XSX, PC|

With the inclusion of Horizon 5 hitting GamePass day one, I consider this a must play for all gamers, racing fans or not.*|XB1|

Playground Games has displayed technical wizardry with this game and while it doesn’t change the formula to any significant extent, the experience found within Forza Horizon 5 is killer.*|PC|

The latest entry doesn't have as much impact or innovation as each of its predecessors did, but it remains the most enjoyable and customizable arcade racer around.*|XSX|

While the changes and additions are largely incremental-especially when it comes to the core game experience-what's here is good enough to warrant a recommendation for fans of the series or racing enthusiasts who've been meaning to try it out.*|XSX|

But I’ve been sticking around with this one. Yes, it is just that darn pretty. Its beauty encourages me to spend a longer time in Mexico, during which I eventually become a better Forza racer (even if I feel like the game could be doing more to help me learn).*|XSX|
|[**Pure Xbox**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/151/pure-xbox) \- [Liam Doolan](https://opencritic.com/critic/1962/liam-doolan)|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-series-x/forza-horizon-5)|*Forza Horizon 5 is an amazing game, don’t get us wrong – if you’re a newcomer to the series you’ll likely have a blast, assuming you like car games. Returning fans though can expect a similar experience to past entries. For some, that’s where driver fatigue may very well set in. After five games, at this point, you could argue the series is no longer doing enough to protect its crown as the top open-world racer. It’s the same process of going to a festival, unlocking cars, racing a lot, levelling up and repeating the whole cycle. And the new additions - such as the EventLab - are more reliant on community efforts. It is mostly a flawless experience, but the lack of evolution is how other franchises like Need for Speed fell behind in the first place.*|XSX, XSS|
|[**VideoGamer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/71/videogamer) \- [Josh Wise](https://opencritic.com/critic/7768/josh-wise)|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://www.videogamer.com/reviews/forza-horizon-5-review/)|*It may well be more of the same, but Mexico beckons, ravishing the eye and devouring up the miles.*|XSX|
|[**ZTGD**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/97/ztgd) \- [Ken McKown](https://opencritic.com/critic/1136/ken-mckown)|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://ztgd.com/reviews/forza-horizon-5-xsx/)|*At the end of the day Forza Horizon 5 is like a delicious cake that is being delivered when I already had a ton of leftover cake from the previous party. It is good and I will enjoy it, but I think it is overpacked and in need of some dynamic changes going forward. I want to feel like the series is evolving instead of just getting prettier with new locales. Even with that said, this is easily the best racing game of the year and it simply looks gorgeous. There is little to fault outside of a lack of evolution and I am sure when all is said and done I will likely invest another 50-60 hours in the game.*|XSX|

>Demon Turf is a strange and peculiar game. At times, it nails its intention, delivering solid platforming sections, packed with ingenuity. However, you’ll often be let down by technical issues and odd design decisions that will ultimately hinder your experience. Although the game, doesn’t manage to stick the landing, it certainly has some memorable moments that will resonate with fans of classic 3D platformers.

-------------

**[Cultured Vultures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/537/cultured-vultures)** - [Ashley Bates](https://opencritic.com/critic/2584/ashley-bates) - [8.5 / 10](https://culturedvultures.com/demon-turf-xbox-review/)

>Demon Turf's few flaws do little to detract from an excellent 3D platforming experience that's worth checking out, whether you're a casual player or potential speedrunner.

-------------

**[Destructoid](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid)** - [Zoey Handley](https://opencritic.com/critic/8094/zoey-handley) - [5.5 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-demon-turf-platformer-ps4-ps5-pc-xbox-switch/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=review-demon-turf-platformer-ps4-ps5-pc-xbox-switch)

>It’s not a soulless game or one without a spark — there’s definitely a lot of love in the final product. It just seriously needed a few more sets of eyes on it to draw out its flaws. A lot of the things that vexed me most severely could be fixed with a few more passes of the floor buffer. Yet here we are, and Demon Turf doesn’t strike me as territory worth conquering.

-------------

**[FingerGuns](https://opencritic.com/outlet/543/fingerguns)** - [Sean Davies](https://opencritic.com/critic/4205/sean-davies) - [8 / 10](https://fingerguns.net/reviews/2021/11/03/demon-turf-review-ps5-demonic-serf-turf/)

>A slick, well designed game, Demon Turf is packed with personality, in part due to its 2D/3D hybrid visuals. Like a tour of the best the genre has to offer, this is a 3D platformer for those that grew up on them and fancy a hearty yet deeply rewarding challenge. It’s only let down by a handful of bugs which will hopefully get fixed via a patch.

-------------

**[GameSpew](https://opencritic.com/outlet/408/gamespew)** - [Kim Snaith](https://opencritic.com/critic/2755/kim-snaith) - [7 / 10](https://www.gamespew.com/2021/11/demon-turf-review/)

>Ultimately, you’ll get most out of Demon Turf if you’re an ardent 3D platforming fan. There’s a lot to like here thanks to the range of skills and interesting upgrades up for grabs, and the levels provide a good amount of challenge. It can get a little repetitive though, so you’re better off keeping your play sessions short and sweet. But lean into its wacky sensibilities, and there’s fun to be had.

-------------

**[Hardcore Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/23/hardcore-gamer)** - [Jordan Helm](https://opencritic.com/critic/890/jordan-helm) - [3.5 / 5](https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=413674)

>Despite its missed opportunities and ideas that don't gel with the core gameplay, developer Fabraz's foray into three-dimensional platforming remains a fun-if-flawed hearkening to the genre's glory days.

-------------

**[Kakuchopurei](https://opencritic.com/outlet/788/kakuchopurei)** - [Jonathan Leo](https://opencritic.com/critic/7505/jonathan-leo) - [80 / 100](https://kakuchopurei.com/2021/11/03/demon-turf-review-kkp/)

>Demon Turf’s art style and graphics mask a deceptive, tough, tricky, and challenging platformer that offers bouts of fun, for about 8 to 10 hours tops.

-------------

**[Metro GameCentral](https://opencritic.com/outlet/75/metro-gamecentral)** - GameCentral - [8 / 10](https://metro.co.uk/2021/11/03/demon-turf-review-3d-platformer-from-hell-15534467/)

>A 3D platformer which wears its inspirations on its sleeve but manages to offer enough individual style and unique platforming dynamics to stand on its own.

-------------

**[Nintendo Enthusiast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/312/nintendo-enthusiast)** - [Jaimie Ditchfield](https://opencritic.com/critic/7934/jaimie-ditchfield) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.nintendoenthusiast.com/demon-turf-review-nintendo-switch-fabraz-playtonic/)

>Overall, Demon Turf is a solid 3D platformer on Nintendo Switch, with a ton of personality and a striking art style. The amount of content present within the game is extraordinary, featuring a plethora of main collectibles, alongside worthwhile side content. Fully completing the game is guaranteed to take a large amount of time, but the variety of turfs to explore will make the quest to defeat the Demon King a memorable one. If you're after another great platformer on Nintendo Switch, then Demon Turf will definitely scratch that itch.

-------------

**[Nintendo Life](https://opencritic.com/outlet/136/nintendo-life)** - [Oliver Reynolds](https://opencritic.com/critic/4681/oliver-reynolds) - [8 / 10](http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/demon-turf)

>Demon Turf is a fantastic platformer that's held back from true greatness by sections of dull and repetitive combat. Push through this, however, and you've got a game that rewards daring and bravery, bolstered by wonderful platforming controls that let you string together incredible combos. The visuals are initially a bit jarring, but the character design really shines through and give it a timeless aesthetic. If you're a fan of 3D platformers from the 'golden' N64 era and beyond, this one is well worth a look.

-------------

**[NintendoWorldReport](https://opencritic.com/outlet/138/nintendoworldreport)** - [John Rairdin](https://opencritic.com/critic/1937/john-rairdin) - [8 / 10](http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/58860/demon-turf-switch-review)

>The performance on Switch is largely great, but when it hits a snag it tends to do so at the worst possible time. But for the rest of the time it's a great looking, great sounding, and great-playing 3D platformer. This is one of those games where despite some flaws, you'll find yourself returning to old worlds to clean up every last collectible as you work your way up the demon ladder.

-------------

**[PC Invasion](https://opencritic.com/outlet/176/pc-invasion)** - [Andrew Farrell](https://opencritic.com/critic/5533/andrew-farrell) - [8 / 10](https://www.pcinvasion.com/demon-turf-review/)

>Lengthy and more than entertaining enough, Demon Turf has a few issues that irked me, but this is a very impressive 3D platformer that does a great job separating itself from the rest of the pack.

-------------

**[Pure Xbox](https://opencritic.com/outlet/151/pure-xbox)** - [Daniel Hollis](https://opencritic.com/critic/6974/daniel-hollis) - [7 / 10](https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-series-x/demon-turf)

>Despite these flaws, Demon Turf is still an incredible platformer - one of the best in years. It's easy to learn but hard to master and is filled with content ranging from easy challenges to devilishly challenging gauntlets. With such a fine-tuned platforming experience, it's easy to overlook the boring combat and performance hiccups. While the latter will most likely be ironed out, the combat is here to stay, but if you can get past that hurdle, Demon Turf is a joyous throwback to the platformers of old.

-------------

**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Stephen Tailby](https://opencritic.com/critic/942/stephen-tailby) - [7 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/demon-turf)

>While the platforming is largely very good, the game does have its drawbacks. The camera doesn't always give you the best view, and fights can be frustrating with imprecise projectiles and a lack of combative options. The boss battles in particular can be irksome things. Even with its flaws, however, this is a game offering lots of personality and refreshing, clean platforming fun.

-------------

**[Rock, Paper, Shotgun](https://opencritic.com/outlet/270/rock-paper-shotgun)** - [Henry Stockdale](https://opencritic.com/critic/2300/henry-stockdale) - [Unscored](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/demon-turf-review)

>It harks back to 3D platformers of yore, but Demon Turf is so much more than a Banjo Kazooie-like. With its inventive platforming, packed to do list and great sense of humour, the latest game from the creators of Slime-San is devilishly good fun.

-------------

**[Screen Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/664/screen-rant)** - [Alex Santa Maria](https://opencritic.com/critic/1994/alex-santa-maria) - [3.5 / 5 stars](https://screenrant.com/demon-turf-game-review/)

>Demon Turf feels like a missed opportunity for its engaging, interesting new world to be catered to such a niche audience. Perhaps these lost levels can give way to an adventure with Beebz that's more up to speed with the general public, but for now, Demon Turf is well worth a try for hardcore platforming fans and difficult to recommend for those less fond of the genre.

-------------

**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [James Bentley](https://opencritic.com/critic/7753/james-bentley) - [8 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/demon-turf-review)

>Demon Turf is a great feeling platformer with some interesting level design, even if its a little inconsistent and a little too long

-------------

**[TheGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/731/thegamer)** - [George Foster](https://opencritic.com/critic/2113/george-foster) - [4 / 5 stars](https://www.thegamer.com/demon-turf-review/)

>Although I’m sure completionists will find a lot to love here, I had the most fun with Demon Turf when I forgot about its myriad side quests, collectibles, and second visits to a level, and just ran through stages with my mastery of Beebz’s moves letting me fly through levels like I was Sonic and I’d finally learnt how to work in 3D. When Demon Turf is fast, it’s glorious, it’s just a shame it has some extra baggage stopping it from peeling out.

-------------

**[VGC](https://opencritic.com/outlet/821/vgc)** - [Chris Scullion](https://opencritic.com/critic/4391/chris-scullion) - [3 / 5 stars](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/demon-turf/)

>Demon Turf looks fantastic and its platforming mechanics are brilliantly satisfying, but it's let down by boring combat and occasionally confusing level design. It's still worth a look, but it's not the best.

-------------

**[Video Chums](https://opencritic.com/outlet/624/video-chums)** - [A.J. Maciejewski](https://opencritic.com/critic/5170/a-j-maciejewski) - [8.3 / 10](https://videochums.com/review/demon-turf)

>Demon Turf is one of the best 3D platformers in recent years and it even rivals recent AAA attempts at the genre. With spectacular gameplay, a huge campaign that's brimming with replay value, clever gadgets, and a gorgeous presentation; it's the whole package.

451,Age of Empires IV has been out for a few days now. What are your thoughts?,"It's been out for awhile and I am enjoying it. The game's core gameplay loop is easy to follow and execute, but I found myself annoyed at the animations, which I suppose is the intent of the game - you take a conscious decision to make yourself vulnerable when issuing new orders to units.

Although the combat is enjoyable, something about the small civilization list made me actually miss the large number of civilizations from past Age of Empires games, and there is very little teamplay going on in 2v2.

Other than the combat and gameplay, AoE4 seems fairly generic to me. Graphics looks better than other AoE games, but it doesn't run well. Unit variety seems unabundant. Missions are standard. The lore is interesting, but still seems generic overall.

What are your thoughts? Do you think Age of Empires IV is here to stay and help bring life back to the RTS genre, or it will flop and be a failed successor? Or somewhere in between, where it will have a low count of very dedicated players and everyone goes back to AoE2 and Starcraft?"

>But then… how much did it cost to go to the movies last time you went? Do you remember what you saw? Unpacking is going to stick with me at least as hard as the latest superhero movie I saw, and it’s going to make the next time I need to look for a new place that much more tolerable. Maybe even fun. I enjoyed the brief time I spent with Unpacking, and I’m not going to stop thinking about it before my next move.

>Brisbane-based developer Witch Beam have made a delightful game that I know fans of Aussie indies have been looking forward to for a long time. It isn’t just a fantasy where I’m more organised than in my real life, it’s a relaxing, stress-free experience that I will definitely revisit.

>Unpacking on Switch doesn't quite stick the landing of the zen experience it aspires to be, but if you can tolerate some frustrating interfaces and controls, this is still a game worth exploring. Just maybe consider playing it on PC since that experience should be much stronger without the control caveats.

>Cute, charming, and surprisingly satisfying, Unpacking scratches an itch that no other game attempts. But it's also too bossy for its own good at times.

>Unpacking is proof that a pixel tells a thousand words. Through simple, zen gameplay and a startling attention to detail a story unfolds in this tiny, pixelated world in a way that just wouldn't have been possible in another medium. That's truly something special on its own – a wholly unique and original narrative experience – and the fact that it's wrapped up in an incredibly cathartic and tangible puzzle game makes it all the more praiseworthy. Witch Beam has something incredible on their hands with this one.

-------------

**[Screen Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/664/screen-rant)** - [William Cennamo](https://opencritic.com/critic/7758/william-cennamo) - [4 / 5 stars](https://screenrant.com/unpacking-review-indie-game/)

>From the tiniest details in each item to the massive story told through simple gameplay, Unpacking is a fantastic indie game. The relaxing gameplay and chill music create a nice getaway experience. It's easy to disappear into Unpacking and complete the entire game in one playthrough, but the experience is so satisfying that players will want to do it again and again.

>A lot of puzzle games involve finding the right place for things. In Tetris, you try to organize tetrominos to create perfect rows. In Puyo Puyo, you want the puyos to fall into the right places to trigger combos. Upon closer review, Unpacking is a game that is sort of similar, though the item placement involves no competition, no stress, and almost no worries about doing things “wrong.”

-------------

**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Steve Wright](https://opencritic.com/critic/3165/steve-wright) - [8 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/unpacking-review-on-the-move/)

>These little niggles aside, a stellar soundtrack from Jeff van Dyck helps to create a sense of calm and zen (that I can only maintain myself for one or two levels at time) as you continue to play voyeur and peek into the lives of the silent protagonist and their loved ones. The anxiety of moving prevents Unpacking from being something I would get stress relief from, but I nonetheless find myself returning again and again to continue its story.

>Unpacking is a wonderfully quaint experience that adds an extra punch to what it means to grow, change, and move on. Even if it could be a bit longer and more extensive, it justifies its place in my game library.

502,It's been a week. What does everyone think about Guardians of the Galaxy?,"Title.

I am a few hours in to this game, and I am really, really surprised by it. Everything from the graphics to the story to the characters and writing has had me smiling from ear to ear the whole time. It feels like they took the best parts of Uncharted, Mass Effect and the GotG movies and put them all together. The combat itself is servicable but not amazing, but I can overlook that because I am having so much fun with everything else.

I may even like the Guardians from the game more than their MCU counterparts. Especially Peter -- I remember really disliking him in all of the promotional material, but he really grew on me. At first, I had my reservations about not being able to play as every Guardian, but the more I play, the more I think that was probably a good call. While every character has their time in the spotlight, Peter is the clear protagonist and if you could choose to be Rocket or Gamora for a majority of the time then you would kind of lose that feeling. 

Also, the writing is genuinely hilarious. I was worried there'd be a bit of a Borderlands situation going on where they'd try too hard to be funny, but I honestly laugh at almost every joke the game makes. 

 I hope this game does well so Square feels encouraged to put out more quality Marvel titles like this one and not live-service cash grabs like The Avengers. With this, I think they've proven that more than just Insomniac can put out amazing Marvel games. 

What do you all think?

EDIT: Yeah, guys, you figured it out, Square Enix paid me to make this thread and praise GOTG but also shit on The Avengers at the same time. You got me lol.

https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/qkdf65/it_had_been_a_long_journey_it_was_time_to_make/

Hi all, wanted to post this mod news because I found it quite interesting. In perhaps a first, a modder/team has been able to create a mod executable which is able to combine the gameplay of two very mechanically different games.

I think this was first announced in March 2021 but a lot of people were skeptical since it seemed like an ambitious plan and the developers were radio silent for quite a while. But today they've released what I assume is merely an early version of it. And allegedly it works, although it's not perfect; the numbers are quite flubbed and the assets aren't all there for an accurate translation.

I was wondering if this is the first instance of such a mod, and what your thoughts are on it."

513,Meta Monday - Rule Updates and More!,"Hello /r/Games, its been a hot minute since we have had one of these! Today we want to go over a few changes we are making to the subreddit rules based on feedback from the community and our own observations. These changes will be rolled out by the end of the week, and the specific wording may vary slightly as we update our bot/rule wiki. 


#Rule Updates


**NEW RULE - Games involving cryptocurrencies or NFTs** 

> Submissions involving crypto or NFTs must adhere to the following restrictions:

> * The submission must focus on the game, game development, or the critical analysis of the game and not be primarily focused on where the crypto or NFTS will be sold, bought, exchanged, or valued at.
* Direct links to crypto exchanges are not allowed.
* Promotion of your own crypto currency or NFT is not allowed.
* Games with the sole purpose of generating crypto or NFTS are not allowed.

We have seen a rather large increase in the number of submissions promoting games which are primarily for generating or exchanging crypto and NFTs. Most of these end up violating a handful of our rules (especially Rule 8 - excessive promotion) and it is our opinion that these often end up falling into ""scam"" territory and we don't care to allow for their promotion here in /r/Games. Articles and news regarding games that involve NFT/crypto in some fashion are not strictly forbidden however - crypto/NFT features are slowing making their way into mainstream games/companies and we think its important to continue to allow discussions about the topic but it must be done in the correct context. 


**Rule 3.1 No off-topic content or comments**

> *Adding the following bullet point:*

> * Meta topics pertaining to the subreddit or otherwise - please direct these to modmail or Meta Monday threads

We have always considered meta topics to fall under Rule 3.1 but this has never been explicitly listed in our Rules which makes it unclear to members of the community where they should ask questions and direct feedback. We will continue to host Meta Monday threads where specific topics or general feedback can be shared, but as always we also welcome folks to direct any feedback or questions to modmail. 

---

**Rule 6.1 & 6.10: Link to the original source & Submissions regarding podcasts and image galleries**

> *Alternate sources of reporting on news from podcasts is permitted*

> *Adding verbiage to specify that if a source such as a Tweet links to a video or article, the video or article should be submitted instead of the tweet.*

We are adding verbiage to Rule 6.1 and 6.10 to make it clear that we allow alternate sources for news which originates from a podcast. Podcasts are permitted in /r/Games but we require submissions about them to be in self posts and timestamped which requires a bit of effort. This is essentially repeating work already done by journalists who have reported on the same news so those articles are allowed. Technically we have historically allowed them in the past but enforcement has been inconsistent on our end so this formally adds the exception. 

Additionally, going forward any tweets which link to a video or article will be removed in favor of the actual article or video being linked to directly. Tweets and other similar media formats do not allow much information and it is preferable to link to the source which contains all of the context and information for the given topic. 

---

**Rule 6.2 Submission Title Formatting**

> *Adding the following bolded clause:*

>Please use the original source’s title when appropriate. If an article or video's title is unclear, convoluted, or does not meet the requirements outlined below, changes are allowed to further clarify or remove editorialized/sensationalized language. **Important contextual information may be added such as *Author, Spoilers, NSFW, Release Date, Platforms, etc*.**

Historically we have been ultra strict with title formatting but sometimes at the cost of submissions being removed due to additional information being added such as release dates or platforms. This change should allow folks to add small amounts of important info to titles **within reason**. For example, if the submission is a link to an announcement trailer and you would like to include platforms and release dates in the submission, this would be ok. However, note that if you do choose to list something like platforms in the title, list all of them or the submission will be removed due to omission (intentional or not) of information. In contrast, if the submission is for something such as a game's patch notes, cherry-picking some of the changes into the title would not be permitted. 

---

**Rule 6.3 Only use helpful and contextually accurate tags**

> *Removing!*

We are removing Rule 6.3 as tags on reddit are not really an officially supported thing in reddit and we don't currently use any bots that would make use of them. Folks are free to continue using them but the appropriateness of their use will be enforced through Rule 6.2. For example, you can continue to add the author's name inside tags, but if you tried something like [YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT] that would fall under unnecessary editorialization of the title. 

---

**Rule 6.13 Review Threads**
> *Removing the following verbiage:*

> Review threads may not be posted sooner than five minutes prior to the embargo lifting.

> *Adding the following verbiage:*

> If a review thread is submitted, individual reviews submitted shortly beforehand may be removed. 

Now the only thing required for Review Threads is a minimum of 4 completed reviews to be available. If a review thread is posted, we will also remove any reviews that were posted in close proximity before the thread went up. Review threads are one of the cooler community driven content in the subreddit so shout out to folks who have been enthusiastic in getting those up so quickly! A bit of a cool hint for managing those... [OpenCritic actually has a super handy reddit export feature](https://opencritic.com/game/11622/guardians-of-the-galaxy/export) that anyone can use to generate those threads. Make sure to check the export data after you paste it though! Sometimes certain info like platforms may be inaccurate - pay attention to user comments on your threads and try to make updates if there is missing data. Specific shout out to our regular Review Thread submitters - /u/diogenesl, /u/cloudsheep0, /u/Ninjyte, and /u/Techboah - thanks for your hard work keeping an eye out for release dates and posting the threads in such a timely manner!

---

**Rule 7.1 & 7.5 Avoid questions that have a limited scope or with a specific obtainable answer & No content related to Tech-support or PC-building advice**

> *Combining two rules and updating examples to be more explicit:*

> Avoid questions asking for help/advice or that have a specific obtainable answer

>- ""What game should I get for <person/situation>?""
- ""Do you recommend game X?""
- ""Where do I download Steam?""
- ""I need help fixing X""
- ""Help me find what game I played X years ago.""

> For these types of questions please try the below subreddits: 

> * If you can't find an answer on Google try /r/AskGames. 
* For technical support or hardware suggestions Try /r/TechSupport, /r/PCGamingTechSupport, /r/BuildAPC, /r/BuildAPCForMe or /r/SuggestALaptop.
* Questions that look for game suggestions try out /r/gamingsuggestions or our weekly suggest me a game thread (link here)
* If you're trying to remember a game you don't remember the name of, check /r/TipOfMyTongue, or /r/TipOfMyJoystick.

We want to be very explicit that questions in /r/Games should be for informative and in-depth discussion and this subreddit is not an appropriate place to ask simple questions that can be solved with quick search on the internet. There are many different subreddits that are far more helpful for certain topics like PC building advice, tech support, game recommendations, and game searching. 

---

**Rule 7.2 Avoid questions that generate very short or list-type responses**

> *Updating the rule verbiage to be more explicit*

> Avoid questions that generate very short or list-type responses

> * ""What game would you like to see remastered?""
* ""What is your favorite online game retailer?""

> Questions posed in self-posts should encourage discussion and not result in short responses or be too limited for quality discussion. [Please see here for examples of quality question and discussion submissions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/quality_discussion) Please make sure to include a number of talking points for discussion, cite sources for claims if possible, and set an example for the effort you would like to see in responses. Talking points for discussion should be in-depth and include your own analysis. 

This rule update is primarily to call out that when asking questions, there are a few things you should include in your submission to encourage healthy discussion of a topic. A question such as ""What game would you like to see remastered?"" on its own is likely to generate a lot of short answers like ""I want to see Metroid Fusion HD!"" or ""I think XYZ games would be nice in 4k"". However, if you include talking points and analysis with your own thoughts, the submission is far more likely to produce more in-depth conversation. Why do you want to see a specific game remastered? What parts of the game feel dated? Would the current gaming trends be kind to a remake of that game? What mechanics felt bad then but would be fun with new spins on them? Going forward we would like to also try to be more consistent on our end with the enforcement of this rule, this update helps set a standard not just for the community but for us as well. 

---
**Rule 8.1 Indie Sunday Restrictions**

> *Adding the following rule for Indie Sundays*

> Please adhere to all Indie Sunday posting and formatting guidelines:

> Submission Restrictions

>* Games may be unreleased or finished
* You must provide video footage of the game in action. This can be a prototype, alpha, beta, etc.
* No key/game giveaways
* Only developers may make submissions for their games - if you would like to highlight a game on your own, please do so in this hub thread
* The same game/developer can not be shared more than once every 30 days. 

> Submission Format

>* Submission must be a self-post (No direct links)
* **Title**: Game Name - Company (or individual) Name - Short description (for example: ""classic turn based RPG"" or ""platformer inspired by Metroidvanias"")
* **Flair**: Indie Sunday
* **Body**: Any links to trailers/footage, a description of the game, plans for release (platform, target date, etc), any additional information you'd like to add. 

> Multiple violations of these rules may result in a ban from the subreddit.

We have been enforcing this rule but just wanted to get it into the Rule wiki for folks to reference. 

---

#Upcoming Feedback Request & News

We have a few other topics we have been discussing and would like to hear what the community's thoughts are - we will have another submission (or more) in the future to discuss these in more detail:

* **Leaks and Rumors** - We look at submissions for leaks/rumors on a case by case basis and check for credibility in a few ways. Author, site (IGN, Bloomberg, Eurogamer etc), sources of info (did it come from 4chan, was it from a data breach, is it retail store backend placeholder data, etc) are all things that factor into the choice to label something as an ""Unsubstantiated Rumor"". We have our own opinions on who and what are credible sources for leaks and rumors but we wanted to ask the community what your thoughts on those were? Are there certain sources that you think are more or less reliable than others?

* **New Community Event** - We are working behind the scenes on a new community driven event that will occur a couple times a month. This is based on an event that we ran in our Discord server for awhile, called ""Indie Gaming Bookclub"". The idea is the community votes on a game to play collectively over a set period of time and we would gather up periodically to discuss the game that was voted on. Details such as how the game will be selected, how often we meet up, and what kinds of games are eligible (Indie, AAA, free-for-all, etc) are all things we haven't decided entirely on so we will be proposing our own vision for how that would work on the subreddit and work with the community to get it in a state that is sensible and fun for everyone."

We are Flazm (you may have heard of our other games - Train Valley and Truck Loader) alongside the team at META Publishing, and together, we’re the developer and publisher behind Time Loader - an intriguing adventure that launches this week. It’s a physics-based puzzle platformer about a *tiny* time-traveling robot trying to save its creator by traveling back to the 90s. You can check out the [latest trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyTm0qLBK98) or [play the demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1301950/Time_Loader/) to see what it’s all about.

We are currently on a final stretch before our release on November 3rd and we’re equally nervous and excited about chatting with you during our first-ever AMA. 

Ask us anything about Time Loader (or Truck Loader / Train Valley), time paradoxes, favorite nostalgic things from the ’90s, or anything else you might want to know about making games!

545,What do you think non-violent open world games should do about pedestrians?,"As a long-time fan of driving and racing games, I've never really been satisfied with how pedestrians are represented in open worlds. Of course game like GTA and Saints Row can have them walk around freely as they are able to be interacted with/run over/attacked etc, but what about non-violent games? 

When I drive around the cities in Forza Horizon games I can't help but feel that they're a bit empty. In those games they just place pedestrians behind walls and bollards so they're unreachable, but it means that all of the sidewalks and streets are empty and feel dead. From memory, Driver: San Francisco and Midnight Club LA both had pedestrians walking the streets that would jump out of the way of your car if you drove towards them. I quite like this solution but I can see how it's a bit weird when you drive full speed down a sidewalk and every single person perfectly leaps out of the way. Maybe there is no true way to make an open world feel lived in without having NPCs be properly interactable. 

Are there examples of this being done better? What's the ideal solution to making a non-violent open world feel alive?"

565,Kings Gauntlet: Chess Revolution - Tall Grass Games - an action multiplayer take on chess,"Hi r/Games!

We’re working on Kings Gauntlet: Chess Revolution. It’a basically a top down 1v1 action shooter with bullet hell influences.

You choose your character from a roster of historical and fictional rulers, then you try to hit your opponent to fill a summon gauge, when it’s full you can summon chess pieces which will then activate whenever they see an enemy piece or king… you know what? 
It’s probably easier if you just see it for yourself ;)

Here’s our trailer: https://youtu.be/LVwgNg9PH3g

And here’s our Steam page: http://store.steampowered.com/app/1646910?utm_source=reddit

We already have a demo out if you want to try it out! 
At the moment you can only play with one character and you can play locally with a friend or against the AI. We’re going to roll out online mode and more characters through playtesting on our Discord in the coming months.
As of now release is aimed at the last quarter of 2022, in about a year!"

619,Does anyone else have a compulsive need to pick up every single item/collectible they see?,"I was playing the original psychonauts other day and I realised that I was just picking up every single item / collectible I came across for the sake of it even if it was to the detriment of my own fun. 

It got me thinking about items / loot systems in gaming in general and whether other people think about them the same way I do.

Now I know what you will say - 'Just don't pick up the item and ignore it', good point, but there's a strange subconscious mental battle that goes on in my head whenever I see a house that needs looting, it goes a little something like this - 'I don't really want to spend time getting it because it won't be fun for me but at the same time I'd feel like I've missed something if I didn't get it and what if there's a really good item in there or I unlock a new mission / level etc...'.

So what normally happens then is I take a minute out to go and loot said house only to find that 80% of the time it was really not worth it and it honestly just felt like a chore that I had to tick off before I complete the game, but at the same time I can't not do it because then I won't get that item I'd get 20% of the time or not get that collectible that would allow me to earn that achievement.

So I made a decision while playing psychonauts that I would stop caring about picking up all the 'figments' and just play through the levels as if they were not there and honestly I had a much more fun. This got me thinking - why are these collectibles even there at all? I'd rather they just not be in the game because I don't have fun getting them. At the end of the day games are meant to be enjoyable, I don't want to be doing chores in my games.

So I'm now actively going to try and condition my mind to ignore video game loot if I really don't want it / need it because I think it will improve my gaming experience as a whole.

Just thought it would be an interesting discussion and I'm curious if other people feel the same way or am I just weird? lol"

**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [81 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/riders-republic-review/)

>If you can ignore the game’s obnoxious attitude and in your face corporate sponsorship, you’re richly rewarded with accessible, consistently engaging representations of biking, snow sports, and wing suiting, coupled with a massive and literally awesome environment in which to compete or explore. Those that are into riding the leaderboards–or just playing with their friends–will have plenty of opportunities to fuel their addiction, but I’m guessing that just about everyone can find joy here in just goofing around in this expansive playground, at least for a while. Whether or not Riders Republic sticks the landing and stays in the playlist of many gamers beyond launch probably depends on a steady stream of new sports to try, and if an actual, thriving community pledges allegiance to the Republic’s competitive modes.

>Riders Republic can be a ton of colorful fun, with go-anywhere do-anything extreme sports gameplay that is instantly accessible and appealing, all wrapped up in a tortilla of weird goofiness. Engage with the stuff you like, ignore the stuff you don't, and get penalized for absolutely nothing.

>Riders Republic is a little surprise, an extreme sports game that pick ups elements from the legends of the genre and apply them to a huge open world, more social oriented, but without losing the focus on the fun part. It's far from perfect, but at least try to do something different... despite the micropayments.

>Riders Republic is more than a revision of Steep than it is a rewrite, a creative team taking all of the lessons learned from a rough draft and starting over from the beginning. It has more extreme sports, sure, but more importantly, it’s a profoundly more social experience. It oozes joy, without relying on the fundamentals of its contemporaries, like combat, winner-takes-all competition, and melodramatic linear storytelling.

>Riders Republic is a fantastic open world sports game that delivers big on massively multiplayer arcade mayhem whilst also giving solo players a ton of content to dig into. There's an enormous, breathtakingly beautiful world to explore here that delivers carefully curated tracks and events for each every one of its sports disciplines, whilst also giving you free reign to head on out and cut your own path through its seven national parks' worth of wonderful wilderness. Yes there's some painful dialogue here and there, as well some issues with bugs and crashes during this launch period, but none of that is enough to put us off getting stuck in and just enjoying the smorgasbord of arcade sports action that Ubisoft Annecy has served up.

>Riders Republic tries so hard to be cool that it deserves a roundhouse kick to the mouth, but Ubisoft's technical chops come out to play here, with an enormous online sandbox stacked to the metaphorical ceiling with high-octane events to complete. This is a game that the French publisher has clearly designed to be built upon, but even day one, with its mix of disciplines and multifaceted Mass Races, it's an entertaining ride. There are minor niggles for the French publisher to iron out, and we'd recommend muting the dialogue, but don't bail on this if you have even a passing interest in extreme sports.

>Despite not having a concept that we could define as original, Riders Republic manages to capture the player in a loop made of one race after another that entertains and works. Merit of the three main disciplines that give variety to the game, suggestive scenarios and a gameplay suitable for everyone that you can master right away. With little understandable naivety from the point of view of cosmetic content, and a camera that occasionally makes a fuss, Riders Republic is a sports video game that certainly stands out in the current landscape. We will meet here in a few days for the final and final impressions.

>Riders Republic is an exhilarating open world extreme sports game with a lot of little issues that build up over time. It's lackluster character creator and insistence on interrupting the flow quickly grows tiresome.  If you're a fan of Steep, Riders Republic is undoubtedly for you. If you're not though, you can probably wait to play this game.

>A definite improvement over Steep, thanks to the Mass Races and the new bike discipline, but Ubisoft Annecy have still got a lot of work to do if they want to break into upper echelons of gaming. It should look to Playground Games and how they craft an elite open-world sports game if they want to reach that next-level, then maybe they too could be mentioned in the same breath as SSX Tricky. Fingers crossed, the potential is definitely there!

>Mario Party Superstars somehow manages to entertain and impress while bringing almost nothing new to the table aside from some annoying stickers and appreciated save features. Nintendo knows the road to success is nostalgia, and they manage to use it to hit the mark every time.

>The game looks modern, but feels more like a classic entry in the franchise. If the thing you were missing was frustration and elation in equal measure, then yours will be a rich bounty indeed. For better and for worse, this is a heaping helping of the cruel whimsy you remember so well. Mario Party Superstars is a glamorous trip down cherished paths you’ve mostly blocked from your memory.

>Looking back at it roots, Mario Party Superstars brings back some of the biggest joys from the Nineties. A wide selection of the best minigames and classic boards originally debuting on the Nintendo 64 surely will satisfy everbody's nostalgia. On the downside it feels like there's content lacking, since there are only five playable boards, no overarching story and nothing worthwile to unlock. As soon as the nostalgia wears off, this Mario Party almost feels... incomplete.

>There's no doubt that Mario Party Superstars was a hasty project, pulled together to capitalise on the party season and keep the run-rate ticking over for Nintendo with a new release. It's hard not to look at a selection of boards that accounts for just a quarter of what was present in the first three Mario Party titles and not think that this is less a ""superstars"" package but rather a rather cynical sampler. Still, what is there is excellent quality, and if you've got Christmas parties and family events on the horizon then you will likely get a lot of value out of this game. Just don't spill beer on your controller. They don't make 'em as tough as they were back on the N64.

>If Super Mario Party chose to take the path of timid ""next-gen"" evolution, Mario Party Superstars takes the opposite, yet complementary, path of amarcord traditionalism. The result is a celebratory episode of fine workmanship, a reasoned selection of some of the most representative tables and minigames of what the franchise has been in its abundant twenty years of existence.

>100 minigames and the five tables would have made a perfect addition to Super Mario Party as a DLC. Unfortunately, when you consider Mario Party Superstars on its own, it strikes me as too thin in content. Despite the excellent compilation of minigames, the rest doesn’t reach the Superstar status.In short, while I appreciate its nostalgic aspect, I would choose Super Mario Party before Mario Party Superstars.

>A hilarious revival of N64 and GC board games and mini-games that proves Nintendo listened to the feedback received after the previous Switch release. Whether you play with friends and family, or via Online, you'll have a blast. Alone, against the AI, you'll have fun with the mini-games, but the board mechanics will bore you.

>Mario Party Superstars is a love letter to the parties you remember attending 20 years ago. A disappointingly slim selection of boards takes the shine off things somewhat, but it's hard to argue that this is the best Mario Party has been in over a decade. No new ideas absolutely feels like a missed opportunity, but by the same token we'd much prefer to have all these classic ideas intact rather than potentially tainting them with unwanted and unnecessary inclusions only added for the sake of being new. Grab a can of Tango and a fistful of 10p Freddos - you're going to party like it's 1999.

>Mario Party Superstars attempts to find common ground with fans of the series. Between the strategic boards, the mountains of minigames on offer and online gameplay, there is more than enough content to keep any Mario Party fan occupied for 20+ hours. Older generations may say, ‘they don’t make them how they used to’ and, for Mario Party, that’s certainly been the case for several years. So, while it’s not a perfect (re)union, Superstars returns to form with the old, the borrowed and the new.

>Overall, Mario Party Superstars does exactly what it set out to do: Make the best of the best in the series. It takes two decades worth of Mario Party minigames and combines them into a perfect little party package. There's really nothing new in Mario Party Superstars, but what is here is pure nostalgia and the perfect entry for any player new to the series.

>Mario Party Superstars succeeds with a fresh coat of paint and just the right amount of quality-of-life improvements to keep it familiar yet far more accessible than dusting off your Nintendo 64. You just can’t beat Mario partying like it’s 1999 (and 2000 and 2001).

>Mario Party Superstars is an excellent package for long-suffering Mario Party fans, but it's almost certainly not going to lead to any new converts. Online multiplayer is a nice feature to have at launch, and the variety of 100 minigames will keep things feeling fresh for your first dozen hours of play at least. But with that said, this is quite literally the safest Mario Party entry imaginable, and even with a hot nostalgia injection, I think I prefer Super Mario Party as the Switch's premier place to ruin your relationships.

>After a decade of games that sought to reinvent and renew the series, Mario Party Superstars rewinds time for a reminder of what made Mario Party popular in the first place. Five gorgeously recreated boards, 100 cherry-picked minigames, and countless opportunities to plan and scheme your way to victory... so long as the dice roll in your favour.

>“Mario Party Superstars” is the return to form the franchise sorely needed. It refocuses on what fans loved about the series in the first place, and most importantly, nails its most important mode, Party Mode. If you can look past the rotating control stick games, and if developer NDcube can offer new content and refine the game over time, you’re likely to enjoy this party for years to come.

703,Game Pass subscriber estimate based on the released reports,"**TL;DR: Based on the numbers we got from MS/Xbox, Game Pass likely had around 16.7 milllion subscribers as of June 30, 2021.**

I tried to calculate the Game Pass subscribers count with the datapoints we have right now from Xbox and Microsoft. 

To make this absolutely clear to everyone, **this is an assumption based on the numbers we got**, it could be close to truth, but it also could be completely false. Also, I rounded the numbers here for better readability.

My initial question was; why isn't Microsoft releasing Game Pass numbers this frequently anymore like they used to? We got three subscriber counts in a time span of 9 months, now the newest count is 9 months old. 

[Microsoft's fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30. ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/faq.aspx)
[They wanted a growth of 48% but only got 37% in this time span.](https://www.axios.com/xbox-microsoft-subscription-gaming-d047cf43-e9b4-4a33-bd25-1ab2c0ad9346.html)

We don't have new subscriber counts but we have previous ones: 

Date | GP subscribers
----|--------------
[Apr 29, 2020](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21242004/xbox-game-pass-10-million-subscribers-microsoft-q3-2020-earnings) | 10 million
[Sep 21, 2020](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/09/21/microsoft-to-acquire-zenimax-media-and-its-game-publisher-bethesda-softworks/) | 15 million
[Jan 26, 2021](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250795/xbox-game-pass-subscribers-growth-microsoft) | 18 million

Since July 1, 2020 is between the first two entries, let's calculate a number based on the assumption that it was a steady rise. A 5 million subscriber growth and 145 days between the two dates, this would make a 34’500 per day. Between April 29 to July 1 are 63 days, so 2’170’000 new subscribers, this means 12’170'000 Game Pass subscribers on July 1 2020. 

If from this date on the rise of subscriptions was 37% for the following year, this would result in plus of 4’500’000, which would give us a total of **16.7 milllion Game Pass subscribers as of June 30, 2021**. 

This would be a decline from Januarys 18 million, but would still be pretty solid, especially when you consider the industry trend where subscription services went down across the board after the initial rise caused from the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, and also the absence of big Xbox franchises in this time span like Halo and Forza. 

This would also explain why they didn't release new subscriber counts since January. 

I hope some of you found this post interesting."

>A traditional turn-based role-player which utilises its tabletop disguise with charm and polish, but isn't long enough to fully capitalise on its ideas.

**[NintendoWorldReport](https://opencritic.com/outlet/138/nintendoworldreport)** - [Jordan Rudek](https://opencritic.com/critic/5065/jordan-rudek) - [7.5 / 10](http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/58797/voice-of-cards-the-isle-dragon-roars-switch-review)

>There aren't many places to explore, random card events in dungeons and the overworld are repeated frequently, and everything comes to a close too soon. Without question, Voice of Cards represents a great entry point for RPG newcomers that employs a compelling and unique aesthetic. If you've shuffled your way through most of the RPGs on Switch, however, you might find this Isle Dragon more of a whimper.

>Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars, the new game from NieR creator Yoko Taro, is a peculiar little game. It knows what it wants to be! And its aesthetics definitely come first. But if you’re at home in its slower pace and tavern feel, you’ll have a good time.

>Yoko Taro's storytelling is laid out on the table in a card-based adventure that'll appeal to tabletop and JRPG fans alike in Voice of Cards.

1,PC or Playstation,"Hi all,

Serious question, does anyone seems any different between playing on console or PC?

Noone attributed him to the real life counterpart and playing games of breaking and remixing lore only serves to weaken the game as a whole. There isnt any silver lining to overreaching actions that harm any part of the game, or any game when the problem was the toxicity between blizzards employees to eachother."
16,League of Legends released an avatar creator. Here's my D.Va take!,
17,I queued 14 and a half minutes for this,
18,Bastion Flank,
19,League of Legend's Arcane series shows how wrong Overwatch went,"League of Legends, besides getting frequent updates, has an incredible lore that is being continually expanded through cinematics and recently, an absolutely amazing looking short series.

I would like people to imagine just what Overwatch could have been. People loved this game, the cinematics had amazing quality and same as with League, people were telling Blizzard to make a movie or Netflix series.

Just look at what is left now. Outside of core Overwatch community, public interest has pretty much dropped completely. People genuinely laugh at you if you tell them you *still* play Overwatch. Meanwhile, League that has been out forever is still relevant and through it's lore even getting non-players interested.

On top of the Overwatch delay, the Overwatch lore was kind of ... in the background. They released a few comics that a lot of people never knew about. The archives missions stopped being updated, we haven't had a cinematic in a long time. So many characters and past affiliations and organizations and events... but it's just crumbling up.

Sad to see. Overwatch could have been a lot more. I'm happy for all the League players, I'm happy for the League team, they put in so much effort, they deserve the profit."
20,Will OW always be like this?,
21,"@Developers - Seriously, take Horizon and Paris out of the rotation","I know you guys like those two maps because it helps speed up queue times because so many players leave and re-queue.  But if you don't make the pro's play on it, and we don't have to watch it, why do we have to still play it?  


I've queued for like 13 games today so far, and I've had to leave 7 of them because they were either horizon or paris over and over.  i mean I get that it helps your queue times suck less, but tons of people leave those maps every time.  I've yet to meet a single person who enjoys Paris or Horizon... and I am sure there has to be some out there, besides the people who designed the maps.

Seriously, get those shitty ass maps out of the rotation please.  They're terrible, very few people enjoy them."
22,Do people just generally hate torb? Why the salt if we're doing good. Quick Play,"I can't count how many times I've had people tell me on my own team that I'm trash but at the end of the game after we lost. I'll have most eliminations. With my shiney gold elim medal. Not turret kills but actual Cannon kills.

It's pretty bothersome. Makes me hate playing torb through peer pressure even though I like it and wait like 5+ min in a queue for it.

It's got to the point now, I don't know if people are complimenting me or being sarcastic. When I actually get a ""Good torb"" or ""Nice torbing"".  From either side. Because of the verbal absue I get most games. Has me in a bad mind set now.

I throw the turret down as a decoy and I snipe shot with his cannon is how I play. Am I doing it wrong? I feel like I'm doing good but now the community has me second guessing enjoying who I play. The more I play overwatch, the less I seem to want to buy overwatch 2 honestly. It's pretty counter strike level of intensity on if you do good or bad. Like I'm not doing bad. According to the medals I'm getting. I'm a dps right, so I go pew pew kill? 

This is quick play by the way. Not even comp level stuff. I feel like I actually get LESS harassment on comp.

24,Something that's always perplexed me about Overwatch's design.,"One of the most basic principles and (more or less) ""rules"" of Overwatch is grouping up to form a cohesive unit of sorts, and yet it seems like there's so many aspects of Overwatch that are specifically built to punish grouping up. Blossom, EMP, Earthshatter, Self Destruct, Junkrat in general, etc.

I think what gets me the most is how Overwatch still manages to be pretty fluid in it's gamestate, easy to read, and fully understandable in the heat of the moment, despite this ""weird"" design. Pretty impressive to be honest."

Still relatively new to the game. So I mostly just queue for tank/support in quick play and I rarely play DPS due to the queue times, even with the priority pass.

51,I can’t even tell when my own team use ultimates unless I’m right next to them. Why did they change the sound so that ultimates aren’t announced clearly?,See rant above.

52,System Performance,"I have been playing for a little while now, when I started playing I had a 1060 3gb, i7-8700 and locked 2333mhz ram. Obviously that’s not pushing any FPS limits so I wasn’t concerned much. But now I have a 2060s, same CPU and 3600mhz CL16 ram and even on all low settings I’m getting sub 200 FPS, which isn’t too far off what I was getting out of the 1060 and shit ram on medium. Anything you guys can think of that could be the problem? I’ve been doing various troubleshooting occasionally for a couple weeks but no noticeable improvement. So far, and I might be missing one or two, I’ve tried resetting driver settings, clean driver install, all sorts of in game setting combinations and even setting PhysX to render through my CPU to maybe take some weight off the GPU (in-game it will regularly go up to 99% usage, also not sure if switching is beneficial, pretty much just tryin shit). I’ve always heard Overwatch is a CPU bound game more so than GPU, so it never made sense to me how my CPU was getting to around 40% usage while GPU is shooting to 99%.

so I tested this while being damage boosted by different heroes to see if it can be [increased.](https://increased.Here) here are the results.

Or, would reducing the overall damage of every character be better? Or just DPS? Same problem, sometimes it feels like some characters do too much damage. And with the reduction in heals, that could mean it's harder for healers to keep everyone up. Or there's the issue of there not being enough damage so damage boosting abilities/ults become a crutch."

107,"Constant frame drops, stuttering and freezing on Overwatch","Hello! 

I've had this problem for a while, and for the past couple of weeks I've been tinkering with certain options and trying to find solutions to my PC constantly having frame drops and freezing every time. My PC specs are honestly quite good other than the fact that I have a proprietary motherboard since it's a DELL prebuilt. 

CPU: Intel Core i5-10400F CPU @ 2.90 GHz (12 CPUS)

Memory/RAM: 8 GB

GPU: Geforce GTX 1650 SUPER

Storage space: 1 terabyte (912 GB usable)

I've tried a couple of things over the time my PC has been having these issues. I might not be able to list all of them but here are all of them I remember:

**Checking amount of cores used** 

I checked to see how many cores I was using, and it said 1 core (didn't click the check mark) although when I restarted the PC it basically did nothing whatsoever and I still had frame drops

**Changing options in nvidia control panel**

The most notable option I changed was the image settings, changing the settings to performance rather than quality. This had a fairly notable change, reducing the lag and freezing compared to when I had it on quality but didn't do all that much in terms of fixing the problem, since I still had frame drops and everything else. 

**Monitoring CPU and GPU usage**

This helped quite a bit, since I finally figured out the problem. Or at least I think so. Whenever my frames dropped, or my screen froze, my GPU and CPU usage went down a TON. My CPU usage went from around 30-40% to like, 0-10% and my GPU usage went from around 80-98% to 0-20% usage. I think this is the main problem with my PC, and I don't really know how to fix it. 

**Turning down texture quality in games**

Doing this basically did the same thing as changing the options in the control panel. Gave me more frames, and reduced the frame drops but the main problem was still there, and didn't really fix it.

**Running as administrator on the game**

This was actually the first thing I ever did to try and fix it. I searched up a video about it and tried to do so myself. For roughly 15 minutes, the stuttering and freezing stopped. No frame drops, no freezing, just pure bliss. I was so glad and happy that I had finally fixed it. But then, after a while the screen started freezing and I started to get frame drops again and I went back to being depressed. 

**Disabling fullscreen optimization** 

Yeah honestly I don't even know what this really did, but I'm pretty sure it just did nothing like the rest of the things I did, but proved to be even more useless than all of them combined. 

**Closing all other Applications**

Like some of the other things I did, it reduced a bit of lag, got a bit more frames but barely did anything to fix the problem. 

**Updating video drivers**

I checked and according to windows all my drivers are up to date. I'm pretty sure I might need to download an NVIDIA driver and test that out to see if it fixes it. This one I'm not sure on. 

I'm really tired of having to try to fix this problem, since with my PC specs this shouldn't even be happening in the first place. I'm out of options and I'm out of patience. Really anything that'd possibly help fix this would mean a lot."
108,How to deal with faster characters as Genji?,"I’ve been playing Genji for a while now (about Gold atm) and have been struggling to secure kills on faster targets.

Usually I can bait cool downs to open someone up (like Moira’s Fade before dashing), but heroes that give me trouble are the ones with lots of consistent mobility, Tracer or Lucio.

I do my best to avoid these character unless they are very low, but it sort of inevitable and I need some tips.

let me explain:

i am, in a way, aggressive. yet knowing that i'm the tank of the team, i change in between my shield and when low, use my shift.i body most of attacks and manage to survive.. but when i turn around.. a lot of times the whole team is dead, normally they die by a flanker or a phara LOL..i use my team chat to ask them to be closer to me so we can push together, and not always works since half of the time no one is in VC.i stay in front of the team all the time, and sometimes ahead of my team so i can get the enemy team attention.

so please please help me here...

what else can i do to win these fights? i am happy to take the blame if my playstyle is wrong, but i wanted to know, but i didnt know who else to ask. thank you!

ps i get yelled at a lot.. saying PROTECT THE HEALER!! , but anas and zens are waaay far back. should i slow down?

118,Wanting people to play a specific hero,"In my games a lot, people tend to try and convince their team to play a specific hero, i.e. winston, dva, sniper, whatever.

It seems like people   
a) Get mad at their team for not having a specific hero in their comp.   
But then also ....  
b) Get mad at their team if they aren't playing well.   


I have maybe 12 hero's or so I can play decently, but I don't know how to play hitscan, winston, dva, or several others. If I were to try and learn the whole roster so I could switch at a moments notice, I would potentially get worse at the heros I can play from not playing them, and also play badly while I learn new ones.

Everyone knows how to play the game at this point. We know what heroes are needed for what purpose and the players have come up with the best hero interactions and combo abilities, but they want to take out a good amount of combos by limiting the tank role to one. 5v5 actually looks fun. 

Two healers for 5v5 seems unnecessary...maybe i want to have one healer, three damage and one tank...but there's no choice

Over time I've installed new hardware replacing each component within my desktop since experiencing that issue for the first time. 

I reinstalled windows and installed a new motherboard yesterday and noticed it happened again today. I thought ""This is still happening?"" and continued research on it. After finding this article:

> Check your in-game audio settings in the game's options menu. Make sure Enable Music and Enable Sound are checked, Master Volume is set appropriately, and your Output Device, Speaker Setup, Sound Quality, and Sound Channel are correct.
> 

I finally realized - I've always had the music muted. These drops in the sound during the match is when the music has a que to play. I'd never knew this because I've never had the music enabled.

131,Highlights should be scored.,"Ik overwatch is dead and they won't implement anything new but...

It's so annoying when your DVa gets Pog with a random lucky bomb when your team was dead and nothing good came of it.

First! Plays should be live scored. Like the numbers should pop up as it's playing and with a final score at the end. This would add a whole new thing to work for. People posting their highlights and highest score pogs.

And for how it should be scored.

1. Eliminations should be worth 10 points.
2. 1 point for each percent of the opponents max hp damage you do. So killing a Reinhart or a mercy solo would be worth 110 point (100 for 100% and 10 for elim.)
3. Exact same with healing
4. De-meching DVa, killing torb, or sym turrets, teleporter or bob would be worth 5 points.
5. Multikills from a single source would be divided by half.
6. Elims in the last 60 seconds should be 125%.
Elims while contesting should be multiplied by something. I was thinking by the ratio of friendlies vs enemies. So if you kill a loan rein on payload with your team it wouldnt change much but if you 6k their team solo it would be multiplied by 6.
7. Environmental kills would be halved maybe.

Idk just a thought. Any other ideas or changes."

It's gotten to the point where on payload maps i'm annoyed when my team goes first and we cap, because i know that if the enemy team caps too, then we have 10 more minutes to go after that. And i'm glad when either team caps at a meter marker, because it means it will be a short match.

Does anybody really enjoy this format?"
147,Elf junkrat. Do you like it. Any opinions on it. Also ask questions about it.,
148,"I really, really wish they'd just make a ""favorited skin randomizer""","I know that this is a small QoL change that only I care about, but imo, every character at this point has atleast 2 S-tier skins, and plenty of A or B skins that I still really like. However, because you only have a limited time before a match starts and because you need to focus on more important things like which hero to play, and because the numerous different choices give me some choice paralysis, I REALLY wish I could have a 'random' option for skins like we do for highlights or victory poses. But obviously, there's some skins I don't want to play as, so it needs to come with an option to select a skin as a 'favorite' to be in the randomized pool selection. 

I feel like every time an event comes, there is always atleast one really great skin I like and I play multiple matches in hopes of getting it in a lootbox, or else I buy it with coins, and I select it for the remainder of the event...then I go back to my main skin for a character and don't use it again until next year event comes around. It's not that I don't like it, I just can't be assed to select it in most cases. 

I know this is like, the lowest possible tier of the problems that are with OW right now, but I still wish we'd get this QoL perk."
149,Overabundance of XBox players on crossplay,"I'm a PS4 user, and I think Crossplay is cool, just noticed in the past couple of days of player there's a shit ton of XBox players (at least I'm imaginine it's XBox players, maybe PC, maybe Switch though I doubt it).

Personally I like POTg clips, but as a support main (rip Ana potg)its a bit difficult to get.

This year's halloween terror didnt give him anything other than an emote, im guessing because he got the Flying Dutchman in 2020 Halloween terror.  


He probably wont get a legendary skin (if anything at all) in this year's Winter Wonderland, because he already has his Rime skin. So here we have a hero who didnt get a legendary skin in 2021 halloween terror, and likely wont get anything in Winter Wonderland. So i think it's very likely he'll get a legendary Archives skin.  


I'm pretty excited for this because overall, Archives has some of my favorite skins in the game. Militia Roadhog, Sniper Ana, Blackwatch Genji/Blackwatch Cassidy, Talon Baptise etc.  


Although I am very curious of what they would make for him. Archives skins have 2 trends:  
\- A skin of what the hero used to look like in their past (Blackwatch Skins, Null Sector Orisa, previously mentioned Sniper Ana)  
\- A Talon member in an actual red/black/white talon themed outfit  


But Sigma already has both of those. With Dr. De Kuiper and Talon, his two rare skins, have already done both of those. As well as Subject Sigma.  


tl:dr Sigma will probably get an Archives skin and it will probably be very cool"

2. I forget the exact words, but an interaction between Sombra and Winston where he excitedly makes a bunch of guesses as to how her technology works, she says she won't tell him, and then tells him to stop when he keeps going.

I feel the first one *has* to be new, because I play those two far more than any other heroes and have definitely never heard it. The second one, it's possible I've just never happened to hear it for some reason, but seems odd. I quite like them both, regardless.

The Mei today just stood there when the enemy ana hit it with her 'nade, for me this was the ultimate confirmation. Human players will typically panic hop or start running in a direction. This bot stayed in place.

1. What should you do as a healer if the other five people all choose DPS and do their own thing, and nobody is willing to change? Is it better to go tank yourself, or find whichever DPS seems to be the least incompetent and just pocket heal them?
2. Is a 99%-100% loss in the third round considered a close game? Someone on the other team bragged afterwards that we were ""easy"", but my understanding is that this is as close as it can be. Was I missing something?  
3. Actually the same guy as the last question, we met him again a few games later and we won that time, and he said it was because he had a ""shit team"". But this feels super subjective to me...?
4. What is the correct thing to do when your team all leaves? We had one leaver halfway through the first round, then at the beginning of the second round everyone else left within 20 seconds. The other team just sort of camped in front of our spawn point (I was DVA) and the second I came out, my mech would explode instantly and I'd be dead before I hot the ground. What should I have done in this situation?
5. Is it possible for there to be a way to not go down in rank if it's due to a thrower or leaver? I feel like this would be more fair.
6. I've heard that group chat is really important for making a plan, but what do you do if someone is saying racist/sexist/homophibic stuff on it? Is it better to keep listening in case they start talking about the game, or just disconnect and hope for the best?

Yet I keep losing because I'm invariably paired with at least one, and often several people who are either not taking the game seriously, or deliberately throwing. Or people who just don't care and charge in solo, and we spend the game effectively 5vs6.

What is the solution here? I'm willing to try anything. I don't know anyone who plays overwatch so it's not like I can make a team of other serious players.

It's like I'm stuck in this dungeon that I could easily get out of, but can't because other prisoners are actively sabotaging any attempt to do so.

240,"I strongly disagree with the argument that Overwatch 2 is a sequel we don't need. We most definitely need it, but it HAS to be sooner.","I've seen so many people expecting Overwatch 2 to be a ""sequel"" in the traditonal sense, and I feel they are not taking a multitude of factors into consideration.

&#x200B;

**1.) OW2 will 99% going to be free-to-play for the multiplayer side of things**, with only the PvE being paid. This was confirmed by multiple leakers, and it just makes the most sense from a business standpoint

&#x200B;

**2.) Overwatch 1 still has a VERY active competitive playerbase** (which currently makes up most of the playerbase) which has spent thousands of hours mastering mechanics, gameplay elements and hero interactions over the course of 5 years. To suddenly shift everything to being completely new without knowing how it would feel to this specific audience (especially considering some these people have their livelihoods dependant on overwatch); just for the sake of 'change' even though the core mechanics in Overwatch are not broken, would be unnecessary.

Would the sequel to CSGO suddenly add things like ADS, sprinting, going prone, rocket launchers etc.? No, because the core gameplay loop is crucially important to the competitive playerbase.

&#x200B;

**3.) Cosmetics and unlockables like skins, voice lines, emotes, etc. NEED to be transferred from OW1 to OW2.** People are not ready to lose years of progress and microtransactions in a snap, this has to be transferred over to OW2. And this can't be done if OW2 works fundamentally different from the first game.

&#x200B;

**4.) There is more than enough content coming for a ""revitilization"" of Overwatch** , which OW2 is, a revitilization, NOT a sequel like Red Dead Redemption 2 was to Red Dead Redemption 1. You have the massive PvE campaign, obviously, but even bigger than that I'd argue would be 5v5, an extremely needed change to the unbalanced and crowded nature of how OW plays

There is a video called ""How to fix overwatch"" by a pro player called Awkward, who is like the top player in every leaderboard in almost every season. In that video, he goes over a multitude of reasons why OW2 should be 5v5 (that video was made before the 5v5 announcement though.).   (EDIT - here's the link-->(  [How to Fix Overwatch - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJRSpAaNlX4) )

&#x200B;

**5.) Besides that, new physics interactions, new game modes, new weather systems, new heroes, MASSIVE reworks which pretty much make the heroes completely new, massive upgrade to the UI and sound etc.. warrant enough for a mostly ""free"" sequel to the game**. Note that Overwatch is a cripplingly broken game from the standup. You may not realise it, but it is. The fact that we have twice the number of DPS heroes than support and tanks is enough to conclude that the OW team did not realise how the game would actually pan out. So just another series of updates to Overwatch would have done absolutely nothing, ESPECIALLY to rekindle any interest in the game from new audiences.

&#x200B;

With that being said, Blizzard is still handling this exceptionally poorly. Except for the rebalancing and testing,  most of the content they are delaying could've easily been made in a year or two max with the size of the team they have, overwatch 2 isn't GTA 6 or something.

&#x200B;

***TL;DR*** \- 1.) it will probably be free to play, 2.) its like a sequel to CSGO, so reworking core mechanics for the sake of it (especially with an active competitive playerbase) is pretty stupid) 3.) As a revitilization it has more than enough content coming for it. 4.) Making it a random update will not spark as much of an interest the way the a 'sequel' does. 5.) Still the game should not have been delayed this much and that's really sad."

Remove her damage while leaving the freeze, so yes she still freezes but she isn't damaging you (by herself) while she does so, so it's still a little bit frustrating but you have significantly more ability to break out of it as long as you have a team around you or nearby.

Also, instead of having the icicle shards Mei shoots out, why not have her call in her robot friend and have the robot do something like charging your teams cooldown abilities and maybe even their ultimates (akin to him powering up the ice station in the cinematic)? The robot could have a certain battery life that would take cooldown time and would go where her wall is now, with the wall replacing her icicles.

Then about her ultimate I would 100% leave damage on and just leave it alone, it seems fine in my opinion.

If you did all this, I would want Mei to go to being a support instead of a DPS or a Tank, but I think she should be since as a character from the cinematic she seems like a very empathetic character and that's why I would like her to be a support as well as not wanting to see her iconic freeze abilities removed.

Feel free to downvote me, but I really think this is the direction I would want to see for Mei, it's less frustrating, more team focused and much more in line with both the iconic aspects of the character and the characters onscreen personality.

Also: If you're going to downvote me, please at least explain to me why I'm wrong."

Thank you to anybody taking the time to read this post. Before I begin, I would like to make a few disclaimers.

1, I am relatively new to Reddit (though I've trolled the boards for years without an account).

2, I've searched for answers to this issue on many many websites and boards and came across nothing that worked. Most posts were also many years old.

3, here is my hardware

CPU: Ryzen 5 2600

Mobo: Gigabyte B450M DS3H

GPU: GTX1650 (main monitors and for games) and AMD Radeon HD 5450 (running a third monitor only. I have checked to make sure that the games are not using this card)

Storage: 1TB SSD (main storage 74% used) 350GB HDD (found it, formatted it, haven't used it yet, but it's in my PC)

Memory: Dual channel 2x8 2633Mhz RAM

4, Programs that could cause interference possibly????

Learning web development so I recently installed

notepad++

VSCode

Xampp

none of these run while I play games

also use

Discord

MSI afterburner (already tried disabling my overclock, turning it off, etc)

5, Fan settings are relatively high, none of my hardware overheats. CPU max is 70c GPU max is 70C with both staying around 50C

6, no overclock on CPU

7, High performance setting on windows and NVidia control panel ( tried with it turned off as well)

8, Tried resetting graphics settings in both games, as well as Nvidia control panel

Previously I could get 144hz consistently in Overwatch and CS:GO with medium/high settings. CS:GO is now 70 FPS and less than 10% GPU usage, CPU usage is around 70% (seems high to me). Overwatch is 120FPS with CPU usage around 60%, GPU usage at 70% (sometimes). On a good day with settings all the way down I can run 240FPS max in overwatch pretty much staying above 200FPS at all times (and have gotten that in CS:GO with a previous GPU). Average FPS for overwatch now is 120FPS with settings all the way down (or at medium, FPS does not change and sometimes seems to do better at medium settings where I get higher GPU usage). Stuttering is very prominent throughout both games even if I cap the framerate to 60FPS. Have tried playing both games without discord running without any changes.

BeamNG runs at 130FPS with settings close to maxed out without stuttering. RF 7.5 is always above 140FPS with settings maxed out, no stuttering. FH4 Runs at 70FPS with high settings (and framerate cap) without stuttering. Have not tested many other games. I basically only play overwatch and do not touch CS:GO anymore, but I saw that they had similar issues with FPS and GPU utilization, therefore I tested CS:GO as well. This is a recent issue, not sure if it has to do with the programs I've downloaded for coding (which have to stay on my PC) or with the additional hardware I added. I don't see how a second GPU running a usually empty screen or a second drive could tank performance so drastically.

I am relatively computer literate, so if I need to do anything more technical to diagnose/resolve the issue, I can. I'm just not literate enough to understand what I need to do lol.

Any help is greatly appreciated!

Update: I thought I wouldn't be doing my due diligence without taking the extra hardware out of my PC. Did not make a difference.

Paid more attention to the MSI afterburner graphs

Overwatch:

CPU 50% 61C Very Very occasional spikes to 100% when I first started in the map. I assume it was just everything loading, but it did tank FPS. Measured the main core/thread using the MSI afterburner graph

GPU cycling between 60-90% 54C

FPS 120-200 (with stuttering and settings all the way down). Drops down to 60FPS at times 

CS:GO:

CPU main core/thread \~50% 56C

GPU \~50% 56C

FPS 120 with spikes up to 300 when respawning

Removing the extra hardware did seem to mildly improve performance in CS:GO, but I had also restarted my computer. I've only been testing CS:GO today as I don't play much anymore, but the FPS did increase from 70FPS to 120FPS, and I was not seeing spikes in FPS when respawning before removing the hardware.

Confirmed that discord makes no difference whatsoever based on the MSI data

I believe that removing the hardware did not have as much of an effect for CS:GO as just restarting the computer had, but I'd also like to keep the hardware in the computer if at all possible."

While it still says 'console pool' on search I am seeing a lot of PC generated names in my QP games on console lately. HiddenPants, GrumpyPants, SneakyTurtle, SneakyHamster etc etc etc. I looked it up and these are battlenet tags that people randomized or haven't changed; apparently 'pants' is a common word in the Blizzard random name generator. Are these PC players? I thought other console players would have their console username as their names, not their battlenet tag.  

Some of these people are definitely KBM, from their POTGs. It could still be console people though, but I never used to see names like this prior to crossplay. Does anyone know if its been changed or is it just people on other consoles that can use their Battlnet tags?"

311,Playing Tanks is just miserable in overall,"Tanks are too team-dependent and I’m kinda glad that OW2 is going to reduce team reliance. It feels so helpless when you stuck in horrible ‘loser’ situations, such as: 

* Tanks push ahead, create space but no one follows them. Then teammates wonder why their Tanks refuse to push because the Tanks fear they would be ditched at the front again like cannon fodders. 
* Tanks shield up at the choke, but others just sit there and shoot back at enemies instead of moving past it. Tanks’ resources are eventually gone or on cooldown, but DPS/Supports continue to peek. They blamed Tanks for not shielding them as they died in the choke.
* The enemy has Mei/Reaper/Sombra who’s hard-bullying the Tanks and none of your DPS (or worse, Supports too) wants to help dealing with them. Like the choke/objective is heavily guarded by Double Tanks + Reaper / Mei, but your ally Handsome Cowboy positions himself in the back like Ashe/Widowmaker and ‘snipes’ enemy Tanks. In the end, he brags about having gold damage.
* You pick Reinhardt as your team request for him but your team gives low-heal Supports like Zenyatta. Your teammate Mercy only pockets her duo DPS. Meanwhile, the enemy Rein is pocketed by Ana + Baptiste / Moira or speed-boosted by Lucio.

Roadhog and Wrecking Ball are the best self-reliant Tanks, but teammates usually hate you for picking them instead of Reinhardt & Zarya.

Is there any way to test if my connection is good enough to handle it before queuing?

332,"Have blizzard done anything to address Smurfing lately in OW or OW2? If not, Blizzard, please address this issue.","I would like to start by saying that I am a proud Gold/Plat player. I am not salty nor do I think I deserve a higher rank. I just want to play competitive OW with people of my skill level to the best of my abilities and if I improve and rank up cool, if my abilities lessen and I go down a rank cool...

**Tl;dr at the end**

The term smurf in the context of OW has some controversy (for reasons I will later address) in how it's defined with people thinking that it's someone who's not playing their ""main"" account, as this is not the case in this context; having multiple accounts is absolutely fine. The term smurf in regards to Overwatch should be defined as someone who is playing at a rank/skill level lower than theirs, which results in, actively ruining their opponents games and their teammates future games.

>""To this day, smurfing falls in a grey area for many online games. [*Fornite*](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/fortnite-season-11-release-date-when-delayed-smurfing-bots-epic-games-a9142671.html) bans players who are caught smurfing, but *League of Legends* famously [defended smurfing](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8limtm/smurfs_are_what_sucks_most_of_the_fun_out_of_the/dzgan7s?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) as a way for players to test unconventional strategies.""  - [Inverse.com](https://Inverse.com)

LoL's definition should not apply here. No one thinks of smurfing as this in regards to Overwatch. If you are a dedicated player and are genuinely attempting to improve, I should not see you on a silver account sniping 4 people in a row. You will either quickly go up in rank, or you could scrim with like minded people that want to test new strategies.

**Easiest issue to address**

In OW ""Group Find"" you can see many groups being made to actively throw games to lower their SR and MMR. Blizzard does not condone this behavior and is not reportable. Even the group title is not reportable. I've tried reporting these titles, but nothing happens, but if I were to report a tittle that is I know blizzard will take action on, it is dealt with quickly and I will get a response immediately. Banning titles that want to throw in rank should have been done as soon as group find became a thing...

**Blizzard does not care about addressing players playing below their skill level aka smurfing**

The last time smurfing was mentioned by someone on the Overwatch team was in 2017 when Moira was released and once again in 2018 when Brigitte was released

>“I know there is a very bad perception of smurfing. But the reality is, skilled players are moved rapidly out of lower skill situations.” - Jeff Kaplan

Here is another attempt at Jeff defining smurfing...

>I think there are two separate concepts:

1. Smurfing. I would define this as an experienced player buying a second account to reset their account progress and internal matchmaking rating (MMR)
2. Boosting. This is behavior some players engage in in Competitive Play where one player is more skilled than their partner and attempts to ""carry"" the lower skilled player to a higher skill tier.

Jeff here is stating that Smurfing is acceptable, attempting to redefine it in the guise of having another account and only temporarily being at a lower rank. No one is claiming this as the issue when bringing up the topic of smurfing.

**Tl;dr**

The most blatant issue is that people are able to actively, through through means of ""soft throwing"" or using Group Find as a six stack, throw games; neither of which are enforceable through detection or reporting through the player report system. If Blizzard wants to prove they are taking it seriously, they should at least ban those that make tittles of wanting to throw in comp."

353,PC is not the master/ideal environment for Overwatch,"During the last week or so there was a SLIGHT change to the Overwatch console experience. Voice chat has been nullified, text chat was added, and crossplay seems a LOT more common. I'm not sure if I'd played any crossplay before the past week and recently it's every match. Generally speaking, not being able to quickly provide information over voice, even though I solo que arcade mode, is akin to having your legs cut off in this game as support and tank. It is frustrating in a way I had not experience in Overwatch in the years I've been playing. Yesterday, I broke my keyboard and...I'm on console. I just needed to break it.

I intentionally don't play the game on PC because I don't enjoy it despite the far superior graphics. I can appreciate why it would be annoying and potentially game ruining if PC players had to hear voice chat, but it would be nice if the chat function for console was tweaked to not suck balls. Currently you must go into the menu and hit a series of mini-game esq keys before you're booted for inactivity. This is much more difficult after smashing my keyboard but that is on me. Aside from a few heroes that are more common with a mouse and keyboard, the major difference between console and PC play is SPAM. If there is something that can be spammed with any affect then that's what happens. There are a few reasons aside from it being a depraved sense of enjoyment that this isn't common on console; arthritis and the price of controllers. A slight plus is that the few time's I've partied with PC players, I've had my best group experiences."

355,Why is the queue estimate always way too optimistic?,"Whenever I feel like it's time to raise my blood pressure and undo all of the progress I've made in the last week of therapy, I boot up Overwatch and am given an estimate of how long I will sit in queue for. Unless queue times are horrendous, the estimate often reads ""< X"" which to me means that on average (not always), I should not be spending more than X minutes in the queue. I've noticed that not only am I \*\*almost always\*\* spending way more than X minutes in queue, but that this is a consistent phenomenon that many people seem to experience, all the time. Even when using the priority pass.

Blizzard must have some background calculus that spits out a range for the maximum amount of time a player is going to spend in queue at any given moment that they're looking at the queue time, and have some confidence level associated with each value of that range. Since they can't know for certain, they have to treat these estimates stochastically, which basically means that there's an element of randomness associated with these values. There's no way to actually know if the queue time is going to be on the low end, high end, or somewhere in the middle of the range, but they might be pretty confident about some subset of those values.

Here's where I think they're being dicks: they consistently pick a low (optimistic) value of that range and give that as the estimate, even if their confidence in that value is incredibly low. They're not lying because the value is in the range of possible outcomes - it's just very unlikely that the queue time will actually be that short. It's the only explanation that seems to account for this widespread bias in queue times. It wouldn't even be such a big deal if it wasn't as frequent or at least didn't happen when using the priority pass. The priority pass is something you earn, but its central function feels like a dice-roll because I know the queue estimates are total bullshit, and I might be spending anywhere from 2 - 7 minutes in queue even though my pass says ""< 3 minutes."" I \*\*might\*\* get a  refund if the estimate was way off, but if it's 2 or 3 minutes over, it will still consume the pass. The justification there is that it's a guess, not a guarantee. But the only thing that seems guaranteed is that the queue projections are optimistic, and almost never conservative. It's the bullest of shits.

I guess I'm not really looking for an answer to my question - I just want to know if anyone else has noticed this and if we should perform some kind of ritual sacrifice to try and appease the California lizard people that run Blizzard. What are y'alls thoughts? 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Blizzard queue estimates are almost always biased towards being optimistic, which feels like they're lying to us. I just want realistic queue projections. Anyone else feel this?"

395,Does anyone else feel that Blizzard misunderstanding the main problem with their current game?,"    When looking at every single change that had been confirmed for overwatch 2 I get less and less hyped. Haven't cared for a single one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I belive it was stated that they wanted less CC, more dmg. If I were to highlight overwatch's main issue it would be not the fact that the CC is there, but the fact that the CC is given to characters who can take off the majority of your healthbar with little to no risk at the press of the button while you're sitting there and watching with your keyboard unplugged. This is why I think characters like Brig and Ana should keep their CC, while characters like Mei Junk Cassidy and Hog should either get theirs removed or have their insane burst dmg nerfed to compensate for the CC they have.
    Paladins IMO is a great example of this. Characters with High CC tend to have a lower dps to compensate in order to 1. Incourage actual team play and 
2. Balance the characters so it never feels like someone took your life and ended your streak because they unplugged your keyboard and removed your entire health bar because it's even humanly possible to react.
Also, having higher dmg in Overwatch is the last thing we need. The TTK is already kinda low and making it any higher will make the game feel worse than it already does. 
    Sometimes I don't get blizzard. They removed scatter arrow because it didn't feel good to get one-shot out of nowhere, but they keep stuff like Hog oneshotting in the game and even bring it back after a while of removing it."

401,"No, the new content from Overwatch 2 can't be a ""series of patches""","I am seeing this sentence way too often. 

You guys are completely forgetting that Overwatch 2 comes with an engine upgrade. The Overwatch team stated that their engine can barely handle the current PVE modes. You cant take something made for a new / better version of your old engine and put it in the one from OW1. Ofcourse things like maps and cosmetics will work fine but we dont even know if the new heroes need the new engine because of complex design / coding. But if they added heroes to OW1 they would most likely have to rewrite their code to make them work in current OW and no one wants to do pointless work if they will change it again anyway.

I am not defending them for not dropping any meaningful update in a while but at the same time I can understand that its not as easy as these comments are suggesting it is. Like has anyone thought about the fact that they would have done it if it werent for literal limiations?"

432,Something Fun to Think About this Sunday Night,"Might be low effort, but the idea is too much fun to pass up, so here goes. 

What if you switched Baptiste's Immortality Field with Orisa's Supercharger? Baptiste now has an extra damage boost ability, more in line with his character and role within Talon, and Orisa fields a Super Immortality Charger, to directly counter aggressive tank ults like Earthshatter and Flux. 

If you hate the idea of Immortality as a concept, then what if Orisa's ult gave all her allies CC Immunity within the ult's effective range? Like she  fortifies her whole team? 

I think these changes would be more true to the character, and maybe slightly easier to balance.

453,Overwatch going free-to-play could probably save the game.,"Or at least to a degree. I think they need to make big sacrifices to win back the trust of the community a bit. Here’s what they need to do:


- Overwatch is now free-to-play but you can only reach level 25. In order to keep getting more levels you have to pay $19.99 for access to the “full game” which essentially just means earning more lootboxes and competitive play.

- On the day it launches also add a new character (Sojourn) and a new map so veterans have a reason to come back too. 


This would bring in a huge new player base and reduce queue times greatly for at least a few months and make the game overall more enjoyable to play. 


The only obstacle would be I don’t think Blizzard would do this since this would mean down the line you would be able to access Overwatch 2 content for free, which in my opinion shouldn’t matter much because most of their money nowadays is made off of lootboxes anyways. Chances are the newer fans after being introduced to the game will be a lot more interested in paying for PVE content than if they never played the game at all, so I think long-term in makes financial sense. I kind of doubt their sales for the game are that amazing that they wouldn’t make a decent amount back on people who end up liking it enough to pay for competitive and leveling."

494,Pharah Rework Idea,"To start, what awaits you is an ungodly amount of text. If you can conquer it all, kudos.I tried to put a lot of effort into it all, and I hope that you enjoy it (the lore bit anyway, might hate the actual rework suggestion, who knows).

First off, I do not think pharah is broken, but rather problematic. The pharmercy combo is extremely annoying sure, yada yada… even just pharah can screw over a game if she’s not answered/countered. I’m taking away her primary fire, replacing it with something similar to what Echo currently has. If she has a regular laser shot, then she’ll have to aim a bit more while in the air and on the ground. That should tone down how annoying she is to deal with in the air, while also feeling less “junkrat” everywhere else. I also have a bit of lore I thought up for the whole change. Pharah seems kind of like a wallflower in the game’s lore right now anyway. Could give her something more interesting to work with (IMO).

Naturally with new abilities and weapons, the hero’s animations and skins and looks would need to be looked at and redone. Blizzard probably wouldn’t care to do that given the time it would take. So this is purely just *something that I thought would be nice for pharah.* Little to no expectation of any changes anywhere close to this happening to pharah.

All that being said, don’t worry about what could be an abysmal rework idea (for now), and if you don’t mind… here’s a story I thought up.

**Short Story: ""Flying Higher""**

Fareeha Amari had always looked up to her mother. An awe-inspired daughter that aspired to follow in her mother’s footsteps and join Overwatch. She spent her childhood training and growing strong so she could be an effective member of Overwatch. Even though her mother, Ana Amari, protested the decision, she continued in her training. As time passed, and Fareeha grew older, the divide between Fareeha and her mother grew. Ana didn’t want to see her beloved daughter risk her life in war and battle, but Fareeha had developed her own strong sense of justice. And it would not permit her to back down. The constant disputes between the two gradually pushed them further and further apart…

It had been an entire year before Fareeha heard anything of her mother. Then she got *the* news. *“This can’t be right… right?”* **Ana was killed-in-action.**The irritation that she felt towards her mother washed over with sadness and regret. Instantly she welled up with emotions. She recalled the last time the two had spoken to each other. She regretted that the last chance she had to hug her mother, was instead replaced with heavy hits and heavier words. If she could only turn back time, and make things right…

After weeks of grieving, she strengthened her mind, knowing exactly what she must do. She got a tattoo reminiscent of the one her mother once had. Ana told Fareeha that her tattoo was a symbol of protection. So Fareeha thought of it as her mother protecting her.

Fareeha finally set out to join Overwatch. She intended to find the man that worked closely with Ana Amari. Jack Morrison. After all, she knew little-to-no information about her mother’s death. So she headed out for the Swiss Overwatch HQ.

There she was. Standing before the facility that would spell out her future. However, she wasn’t allowed to go any further. They wouldn’t even take her application. When she asked for an explanation, she was simply shooed away.

This wouldn’t do. This wouldn’t do at all. After years of training her body and mind, and losing her mother… She felt that she deserved more than this! As she was being forcefully escorted away from the facility, she had a moment of desperation. She shouted out that she was the daughter of Ana Amari! All she wanted to know was how her mother had died. At the very least she wanted to know that much… But no one listened.

Fareeha felt as if she had lost everything. The very thing she endeavored to do her whole life, felt out of reach. What would her mother think… “*She’s probably happy that I wasn’t able to get in…*” She quelled the distasteful thought quickly, replacing it with a new-found conviction.

She hadn’t walked too far from the facility when she made up her mind. “I’m not going home empty-handed!” She turned around, glanced at the entry-way to the facility, and then beyond it. If the gatemen wouldn’t hear her out… then *they* will.

Hopping fences was child’s play. Sneaking around the guards… not so much. But it wasn’t long before she was against the glass of the facility. That’s when she saw him… the well-known **Jack Morrison**. It looked as if he was… arguing with someone? No matter, surely he would hear her out. She just needed to get his attention. She had no other options at this point anyway. She started to make her way around the side of the building to get to the door. That’s when she heard gunshots. *“Were those from inside?”* All the guards turned and ran to the facility in order to investigate the noise. That’s when she was spotted.

She ran fast, faster then she knew she could run. If she could just get **his** attention! The door was in *arms* reach, when a violent shake threw her off balance. And before she could even hit the ground, the explosion had ravaged her body…

She woke up dazed in a hospital bed. To her left she saw two men in blue. She could hear talking, but strained to make out the words. *“My ears hurt… what are they saying?”*She listened as best she could while pretending to still be unconscious.

“We could just pin the explosion on her. No one will question it, she wasn’t even supposed to be there after all.”

Did she hear them right? No… surely she heard them wrong… *“I’ll record this just in case…”* Fareeha tries to reach for her phone on the table next to her…

“Well… it might be for the best. After the Antonio incident, and this recent event… Overwatch has got to be on it’s last le-”

Interrupted by the panicked and pained (but weak) groans of a patient, the *agents* turned around to see a fully awake Fareeha.

“Heh, guess she saw the damage,” the *taller* agent said while pointing at her damaged body. “Dang it, I guess that means you heard us talking too, huh?”The *taller* agent begins to walk toward Fareeha, but the other agent rises up to stop him.

“What the hell are you planning to do exactly?”

“You said it yourself, Overwatch is on it’s last legs, we don’t need any more conspiracies. We’ll just, tell the nurse she stopped breathing suddenly.”

The *other* agent pulls her weapon on the *taller* agent. “Stand down, or I will shoot.”

“Don’t get all holier-than-thou with me, you were ready to frame the poor sap just a second ago,” the *taller* agent said while pulling his weapon in response.

“Yeah, but this… this is just wrong.” said the *hypocritical* agent.

After a short standoff, the *taller* agent swept the *other’s* leg. Fareeha watched anxiously, knowing that the victor whether she lived… or died.

However, after not too long the loud noises from the fight prompted security to come to the room and diffuse the situation.

Fareeha was glad to hear nothing of those two agents or the lie they were plotting ever again. But that event permanently stained her view of Overwatch. All of the reports of Blackwatch and other allegations of Overwatch that she had heard (but ignored) before now, came back to her in full force. The faultless heroes she once looked up to, began to look like any other corrupt organization or government that she detested.These heroes of justice she loved, were no more.

After two months in the hospital Fareeha was allowed to leave. They fitted her with standard prosthetic arms so she could live a life reminiscent to what she had before. Although not everything was salvaged. Fareeha had given up. She had given up on becoming a member of Overwatch, she had given up on finding out the truth about her mother’s death… she had given up on everything. Her once strong sense of justice was replaced with despair and hopelessness.The now somber and sorrowful Fareeha made a living delivering packages to people. She kept at this for months.Then, she delivered a box of scraps and metals to a certain friend-to-be.

Brigitte and Fareeha became good friends quickly after meeting. She introduced her to Reinhardt, and *the rest of* her family. Though, she remained oblivious to the fact that Torbjorn and Reinhardt were members of Overwatch.

As the two grew closer, Brigitte saw Fareeha’s good nature many of times. She observed as Fareeha never turned a blind eye to someone in need. Even though there was something sad and gloomy about the way Fareeha carried herself, she never passed up an opportunity to help those in need.

Brigitte’s curiosity moved her to ask how Fareeha lost her arms. After hearing her story, Brigitte felt moved to offer her the power she needs to fight for a just cause, just like Fareeha had always wanted to do.

And so, after weeks of hard work and some serious fine-tuning, Fareeha was fit to fight.

And fight she did. It wasn’t too much longer after she got her new arms from Brigitte and Torbjorn that Overwatch was disbanded. The heroes that once protected everyone had fallen, and evil had clawed its way out of its ashes. And so Fareeha set out as **Pharah**, now more determined then she had ever been before, to deliver her own brand of *sweet justice* onto anyone deserving of it.

*“JUSTICE RAINS FROM ABOVE!”*

**end.**

***Weapon Changes***

*You skipped it didn’t you… you deviant.*

Pharah has two cybernetic arms, one that can transform into a pretty standard but effective laser shooter(default right arm). And the other that can transform, then load and fire explosive payloads(left arm).

**Right Arm:** *58 damage / shoots once every 0.45 seconds / holds 8 shots / 1.2 second reload***Left Arm:** *95 damage direct hit (aoe damage) / shoots once every 0.8 seconds / holds 2 shots / 2 second reload (reloads while not being used).*

Switches similar to how torb and mercy can swap. Swapping is instant, and takes 0.2 seconds before you can use weapon, also similar to mercy and torb.

Abilities

**Abilities:***Hover jet passive remains unchanged.Jump Jet ability remains unchangedBarrage ability remains unchanged*

*New Ability* / **""GraceFall""***Pharah overcharges both of her cybernetic arms, then using her fists and jump pack, flies downward and slams into the ground, dealing damage and knocking enemies back.*

Damage: 70Cooldown: 8 secondsAOE: 3.5 meters*Using this ability lowers jump jet’s cooldown by 3 secondsKnockback is similar to junkrat mines.*

**Notes:**

Well, there goes my day.Uh, right… Idk what to put here. Wanted her to feel much more dynamic and fun. I love the idea of the GraceFall ability, definitely not an ability you want to use on a whim. Grounding yourself when your greatest ally is aerial combat is risky. However it also feels more fair if you are against her. She can’t just be miles away and push you off the map. She has to get really close in order to use the knockback. Alternatively you can use it to descend much quicker if you want to get out of the air faster. AND, using the ability reduces jump jet CD by 3 seconds, allowing you to get airborne soon after using GF.

Having arms that can just transform into weapons seemed pretty cool in my head. And I’m having fun imagining what that would look like in-game. Anyway, yes she still technically has rockets. It felt kind of fitting tbh, and allowed her to use both her weaponized arms. That being said, it’s definitely not something you should be able to just spam and get value with as easily. The rate of fire is 0.05 seconds quicker, but it’s lost most of it’s ammo, and 25 damage. Also it takes a considerable amount of time to reload now. It’s probably more of something you want to use in certain situations rather than all. A big point was to change her primary fire to something else, and while have a rocket launcher (arm) is still an option, I think it is definitely not as annoying or spammable like this.

That’s about it."
495,How populated is the game?,"So yeah title. 
I’m currently on my yearly “redownload overwatch” phase and these queue times are actually ridiculous so it makes me wonder; is this game really THIS dead?
I mean the question does answer itself because like i said before i haven’t played in about a year and literally everything is the exact same assumably not a lot of people would still play the exact same thing for that long.
But anyways, yeah I’d love some insight from you guys if its just me or is the state of the game really this bad."

I ranked in gold when i first started the game and I've been trying to improve my rank since then, but i can't. I genuenly believe i have improved and deserve a better rank in the game. I constantly get gold medals in every game and crush the enemies. I've figured the game ranks you from your last season which is the main problem because i get gold ranked players which is keeping me down from ranking up (reinhardt who pins in alone or healers who just walk in the enemy team). I watch Overwatch on youtube all the time and play when i have time to improve in the game.

519,"If you hate Overwatch, just play TOTAL MAYHEM","Listen, the current state of overwatch sucks right? If you hate dying so much, if you feel like you don't use your ultimate that only becomes useful once im a blue moon, if you feel like your abilities will purposely kill you more than it kills them, if your healers suck, if your tanks suck, if your DPS can't do anything but cower outside the point, if you feel utterly useless to change the course of the match, then ladies and gentlemen, I have the perfect mode for you! In arcade modes there is this precious little orange gem that stands out called Total Mayhem, you get double the health, faster ability reload, FASTer Ultimate charge, you get to feel like a badass and boy you bet, everyone else is going to feel like a badass, AND BOY YOU BET THE WHOLE MATCH GONNA FEEL LIKE A BADASS. Literal wars are waged in one match, trench warfare gone World War 2! But what's After World War 2? THE COLD WAR BUT ITS GONE HOT. Ultimate flying everywhere! DVA nukes constantly decimate the map as your team take cover behind your shield power generators called your tanks, your healers are everywhere and healing everything that has health bar! Desperately charging their ultimate that charges so fast they are more risking their lives to save you, or your actual brave tanks diving in to soak all the damage they can with their massive healthpool while you help them in return with a less but still devastating dps ultimate, enough to clear the board and mop up any survivors! Total Mayhem is more O verwatch than actual Overwatch! Real heroes in play! Long lasting engagements that will keep your evry ability on your toes until either one of your team pulls off a unexpected surprise attack, or end up decimating one team with full ultimate firepower!
Despite all this, there are the villains that will seek your demise, don't think your enemies wont use everything against you, they might hire a sombra and shut your mayhem off! Or the menacing Moira that will contest that payload and heal her team at the same time until you and your team decides that Moira shall be K.O.S. Or A Winston that could save the enemies from utter defeat, Or Mercy that will revive your enemies until your team decides it's time to go birdhunting! Sigma pulling your entire team off the payload in an act of c9! You have so many factors with you and factors against you it's actually fun, it's even so much fun with your friends! Communication is more key as you'll need communication just to kill enemies and in a sense progress the match, unless you are on a 1v1, then it's only you or them that will come back to the main fight victoriously. Two good teams will make a match last what feels like forever, but the more time you put into that fight, the more worth it is to see your team come out top standing on the dead bodies piled up on the point. No one is left out, no one is left standing.
Sure there are some faults in Total Mayhem, more of how widowmaker is outgunned and outmaneuvered in every way possible. Or the quality of the rest of your teammates are, but you are still guaranteed to win a match or more especially after a team switchup, and with a group, you'll feel at times, invincible! Watch out for those d va nukes and EMP, keep your healers safe, keep your tanks tanking, keep your DPS constantly up and guns blazing in this Lore-Accurate arcade mode, and even the lowest of low level portraits will be seen on fire! The mode is practically even Smurf-proof! I have yet to encounter any and I have over 600 hours in the mode!
This is Total Mayhem, Real Mayhem, you either win or lose, so why not go out in a bang or 5? Depending how chaotic you are! 

Muahaahahhaaah!"

524,Just going to reiterate my theory on why Sombra might turn into an omnic overwatch version of titanfall Simulacrum,"I made a mistake on my previous sombra turning into an Omnic theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/SombraMains/comments/q95her/how_sombra_might_turn_into_a_omnic_in_ow2_story/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) well I have a hypothesis on why she has the Cybernetic arguments on her back as well as on her head [as pictured here](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch/images/b/b6/SombraCyborg.png/revision/latest?cb=20180619201214) well I found something more than that I’m going to bring up the Simulacrum from titanfall because the cybernetic augment might be more important than you realize scientists right now are trying to figure out how store the consciousness of a person into computers because that would give us the ability to skip the worst part of life death. With your consciousness stored digitally it can be moved around and can be downloaded as well can be saved 1000 years later your family could visit you and in your computer form could ask you questions like What was it like for you to be alive during your primitive era and you would be answering those questions because it wouldn’t be a copy of you it would be your consciousness. This would solve the next problem if nanites are going the answer which is one of the most difficult things about the pilot training is that it has a 98% fatality rate obviously with that type of high death expectancy a lot of people would be hesitant to die over training that is unless it’s only the body that dies if you knew with absolute certainty that your consciousness would live on and it could be transferred to another body the training death rate really doesn’t look as bad as it did win so because death is not permanent it’s one of those OK well I might die I probably will die but I’ll be alive again so whatever. To support my hypothesis on this was gonna blisk heard as saying he’s going to hold a grudge whenever you kill another pilot.This has been recorded and will be able to be placed into another body so without the fear of death pilots pursue this training as a detriment to their original Meatsuit an overhaul to the brain as well it will help establish a neural link apparently very intimate thing concerning your brain and machine your actions become one and make time will not work with pilot better almost as he earlier about the download of consciousness this would also fall in line with how I pilot to be regen it’s not the training has taken a toll on your body but you can be regen at a price as your memory but maintain your skills it sounds an awful lot like the recording of a pilots consciousness concerning battle social interactions perhaps the best human personality is recorded but a collection of them I spend more time in the cerebellum responsible for muscle coordination but also any other autonomous nervous sections which are typically responsible for like knee-jerk reaction if you didn’t know operate almost as like a mini brains that make choices to move your arm legs hands feet things like that quickly if you grab something really hot away without the brain actually sending that signature away is it survival technique as it takes longer brain rather than say the middle of the back anyways pilot so when they reach in they remember battle but they might not remember everything concerning weapon usage or certain functions of the titan weapons money you were able to get better than I things about weapons which means you can’t really region of a new body how exactly are they ranked in terms of importance people I think I’ve got a pretty good idea on the hierarchy as a pilot progresses he or she becomes more deadly and they are going to gain in going to earn them weapons titans stronger weapons and then stronger titans and so on and so forth all pilots start out as tier 1 pilots you get basic weapons things that if you are killed in battle won’t really be missed by imc or milita these pilots are going to have your basic human body they will have the nanotechnology injections so that they can be recorded and saved as they learn but your equipment isn’t great. If your survive long enough then you get to tier 2 tier 2 pilots  are gonna possess more augmentations and have better weapons they have either  survived long enough or halved their consciousness saved and transferred that they have learned to be better and not die or in gamer talk they got good they will have active camouflage grenades that aren’t just explosive and they will probably sport your precise function there titan shows their triumph as the stock weapon and armor have been changed to a more personal touch tier 2s I believe are the main stopping point  for most pilots in their human form as by this point your literal body to slow you down and hinder your neurons aren’t quick enough anymore your muscle feel like they’re too sluggish and contraction there is a better from to be had so let’s more on to [the next tier.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/titanfall/images/e/e4/Stim_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170524115001) The next tier is tier 3 and there are no humans a common experience affective in there though they aren’t hindered by the slow mechanics of a human body there is no risk of falling and hurting yourself and in theory not just that but you know longer have to rely on muscle contraction to kill an enemy at this point it’s all hydraulic presses and shiny metal. Tier 3 pilots have bitter on the longestI have a toughest and have the best equipment he would be the most effective a higher but they are probably going to be the most expensive as well. So biologically speaking there must be some heavy augmentations. So How does this relate to sombra getting her Cybernetic augments on her back once again good question Do any of you remember the rank chip from the first titanfall game in the beginning of the match it clearly says greetings pilot I’m your rank chip I’m tracking your performance good luck Which might explain how data was gathered so fast. So to Summarize

1. Your consciousness is being recorded via nanites But given she has cybernetic augments it might may work differently than nanites in your body 
2. Your consciousness would be transferred into a computer and can be moved around and saved 
3. Every time you die they simply rebuild you

I think think my sensitivity is fine, maybe could be a slight bit higher, but “flicking” (I guess you could call it) is really difficult for me. 
I feel like I cant consistently hit someone moving around a lot. Like I cant keep up with their movement. I haven’t messed with my settings much besides the sensitivity as I’m scared I’ll mess them up. Is there any advanced settings I can adjust?"

Do something about it, the bullying is enough to get kids want to commit suicide.","Seriously, I am not saying this lightly or just for attention. I don't know how bad it gets if you're gold and below.

But on xbox, especially since crossplay there's been so many people just creating throw away accounts because it's free. Every 2 games you have 1 person at least intentionally just afking and abusing everyone through sexual references and harassment via the match chat in Comp. It's infuriating to try get a proper game at all now and especially during placement. This 'their mmr gets sorted in 15 games or less' does not work with us because of how quickly and how many accounts they make.

There's groups of them who are friends and do this so badly and outright abuse anyone for the hell of it. Not the simple 'trash/useless/diff/uninstall' comments, but full on abuse and wishing people to kill themselves. If you avoid one, they just get on their alt and keep trying to find you in game to torment.

Make new accounts not able to join comp until they're at least level 100 or something. It's so ridiculous that nothing is ever done about this. You just want to have fun and play, but you can't even do that with chat off because of what you see kids saying to others, and ruining your games for hours just because they can. If you don't have good friends or play during a specific time (especially Australian) then you will find it 10x harder to get to diamond if you were normally in it, just from the game play sabotage alone.

There's always talk about mental health awareness for games and what not. But you never see anything done about it. Or console versions get ignored because the devs just look at the pc version and say everything's fine when it really is not."

555,what do you dislike the most about the game in its current state,for me the worst part is ok never actually fighting the enemy team and what I man by that is it's never a equal fight either in absolutely destroying the enemy team without any competition or the enemy team is absolutely destroying me with little competition whereas in other games it's more like a back and forth or atleast it's alot less common for one team to be significantly better than the other

But something that really doesn't help my anger issues is the fact I can see my SR. I'm sort of pursuing higher ranks, but I really don't want to see my SR when I'm doing it. Whenever I queue up for competitive, I see those numbers, and if I see say, 2480 SR, I want to win the next match so I can climb to platinum. And that has left me the most frustrated I've ever been in a long time because I'm pursuing that SR. Some way to remove those numbers from the screen, and possibly my profile (From myself), would be really helpful and would most likely reduce my anger issues. Any ideas?"

Two of which I have ideas for. As a main tank player, the state of the main tank is very weary and tiresome. Winning occasionally but getting mauled by every cc in the game continuously. My two ideas were these:

Reinhardt: charge cancel
— I know they are already talking about this for OW2, but could we get it now?

Winston: jump cancel (maybe just for ultimate)
— It is tough using Winston in many comps (if you don’t have a very coordinated team) because he has a low damage output, and very linear movements. A jump cancel would help players keep from overshooting their targets (particularly while ulting) and make him more precise and effective. The jump cancel would only make him begin his descent earlier, it wouldn’t drop him straight down or speed up his fall. It would rely on timing and memory to be aware of distances to his target. 

Like I said, I know the charge cancel is in the works for OW2, but I’ve never heard of a Winston jump cancel, and was wondering if we could go ahead and get these in OW1 to help maintain main tank enthusiasm."

If you get good with the healing you can easily have games where your healing is in the 15-30k range. I literally climbed from low bronze all the way to gold in a week literally playing lucio 98 percent of the time. I do feel there is one exception. If you have a bridge or zen, go Baptiste. Once, you hit Gold, you can start expanding heroes since people will now start working with you a bit more. I actually recommend strongly against playing Mercy. You hardly have any damage output, and teammates are going to leave you to die. The only reason they will request mercy is because they suck and just want a pocket because they can't stop dying. If you're in low bronze, hammer Lucio or Moria, and occasionally Bap. Do this. You will climb, and you will climb fast.

625,I'm hyped for Overwatch 2 because it reminds me Project Titan.,"A lot of you are too young to know or remember. but before Overwatch, Blizzard was working on Project Titan. It was going to be Metzen's new baby. Chris Metzen, was one of Blizzard's pioneers and even voiced Thrall from Warcraft. If you ever wondered why Orcs get too much screen time despite being the franchise's early villains. It's cause of him.   


Basically, Project Titan was supposed to be a shooter MMO type of game. Set in this planet where you get to travel to distant worlds, do adventures etc.  


They couldn't finish it, it was too ambitious. But they finished the PVP mode, that is how we got Overwatch. Metzen set up some parts of the world, heck Soldier 76 is based out of a comic character he was trying to write. A lot of the character's designs and concepts come from Project Titan, Mccree/Cassidy was a space a marshal Jim Raynor kind of dude.  
 In the end, Project Titan not getting off the ground burned him out, and once Overwatch was set he left.  


Fast forward years later, we're getting Overwatch 2. It's not Project Titan's MMO shooter adventure thing but we got something close. the PVE, the adventure side, going out on procedurally generated missions, raids, campaigns, boss fights. We're getting that. I've always felt we needed an adventure with the Overwatch characters, the lore brings us there, the story brings us there. These guys are GI Joe fighting Terminator Matrix bad guys. They were made for adventure. Granted we love the shit out of the PVP game, we also need that adventure.  
But we're getting a piece of it I know a lot of you are complaining about the game's development cycle but to be honest, we should all want a polished game rather than a rushed mess that a lot of you seem to want.  
More than enough rushed games out there have taught us that. Sure we loved the shit out of Overwatch when it came out but imagine how much better that experience would be if we got it with all the tweaks and balances we got now.  


If you're mad about Overwatch 2 being delayed, play other games. I recommend Deep Rock Galactic.   
If that doesn't work play something else, if you don't want to play, do something else. Overwatch isn't the only thing."

632,Returning to Overwatch after 3+ years,"A combination of nostalgia and boredome while waiting for other game releases compelled me to redownload Overwatch a few days ago, and honestly I fully expected to play a few quick games before the, ""god I remember why I don't play this anymore"" feeling set in but I've been having a genuinely good time with it again! 

Back when Overwatch was at peak popularity I would always group up with at least 1-3 of my friends. Being my first FPS, I was naturally the worst player compared to everyone else who had years of gaming experience over on me lol. Since I felt bad for holding everyone back (my words, never theirs), I wound up becoming a support main because it was an easy way to help my team without having to struggle with the learning curve on my bad aim and game sense quite so much. I always wanted to try and play characters like Hanzo and Genji more since I'm basic and think they're neat, but my friends were always much more competitive than me and if we lost a lot of games the mood would be brought down pretty quick. For me, the real Overwatch experience was the friends we made along the way so I just wound up never finding the time to practice my DPS. 

Now, my brain might remember how to play still, but my muscle memory is absolute dog dookie! But playing alone, having almost no one ever join me in team chat, and the role queues allowing me to not have to fight over being a DPS with 5 other people anymore, I've finally started to live my best pathetic little life and get to work on Getting Gud. By no means do I ever think I'll actually be a good player, and I have no competetive drive, but I make myself laugh seeing the goofy ways I get myself killed. (:

I don't know how long I'll want to keep playing this game again, but I so dearly miss experiencing it with friends and being part of the community around it. I know a large part of that has to due with Blizz essentially abandoning the game in favor of focusing on Overwatch 2, but are there any content creators/streamers you all would recommend? I'm not very into competitve/OWL things. I'm basically starting over as a level 1 baby currently only interested in casual play, but if there are any discord servers or anything like that with other like minded chill people willing to be patient who'd like to play with me I would love to make some new friends and memories together!"

Toss a bastion or Junkrat on a ceiling, slingshot D.va into the fray, or reposition BOB. 

Hell, have their movements be gloop grappling like widowmaker. Give them a standard weapon that slows down enemies rate of fire and a little damage, or turn into a puddle and hide next to a payload.

2) I can tab in, but when I get in I just see the background of the main menu, no buttons, no queue timer, nothing. At this point i just ALT+F4 since I'm not sure what happens If I let the queue timer finish and find a game (task manager says the game is responding)

662,Brigitte: A Case Study On Character Balance,"# Introduction

I've always felt like the Overwatch developers haven't made good balance decisions with their hero, but I've never really been able to properly articulate why until recently. Something I read got me thinking about Brigitte, how she was a fun character to play, horrible to play against, overpowered, but seemingly resistant to every nerf the developers threw at her in the months following her release. By the time she made it to Role Queue, she was in a better place, but was beginning to lose her identity, and she still had a ways to go before being healthy for the game, regardless of what she had to give up to get there.

I believe that analyzing Brigitte, the problem she was meant to solve, why she resisted so many nerfs, and how she lost her identity, can give us insight into why the devs never seemed properly capable of balancing their heroes effectively, and why characters paradoxically seemed to end up in better places than they started in spite of that.

# Brigitte: The Answer To Dive

People were getting tired of the dive meta. While arguably more dynamic to watch, and likely one more enjoyed by skilled players looking to push their abilities and teams to the limit, it simply lasted too long. Healers and tanks didn't exactly have tons of other options to choose from, and players didn't seem to have the capability to work together as a team in order to solve the problems they faced. Brig was supposedly the answer to the problem. She was a hero that would put an end to this oppressive and repetitive status quo.

She was designed to counter dive, but ended up being incorporated into the very compositions she was meant to defeat. Tanks couldn't do enough damage to take her down, dive heroes couldn't overcome the mountain of traps she presented, and her shields and mobility allowed her to evade and survive whatever DPS threw at her until she reach a favorable position. Since the best way to defeat Brigitte was to have one on your team too, the meta changed from ""Dive"" to ""Dive + Brig"" because the tools she provided were equally effective against everyone.

To understand how this happened, we need to first understand what a dive comp is.

# Dive Comps

A dive comp is a group of character who are mobile and capable of generating a burst of damage very quickly. They target a vulnerable enemy player, attempt to eliminate them before their team can react, then either retreat if they failed, or continue attacking if they succeeded. Characters designed to be effective at diving generally do not have a lot of health, and they lack the resources necessary to sustain their high damage output through extended battles. To counter a dive, a requires a team to do 1 of 2 things:

1. Survive the initial burst of damage and organizing a response.
2. Force dive to waste so many resources overcoming obstacles that they have no resources left for the actual attack.

This means that they are effective against **Brawler comps,** but they are weak against  **Heavy comps**. Why? For the sake of brevity, I'll define these compositions in relation to how they interact with a dive comp, starting with Heavy comps.

**Comp Summary:** High Mobility, High Burst, Close Range, Low Sustain

# Heavy Comps

This composition embodies everything a dive comp has difficulty overcoming. They stick together, making it difficult for dive targets to separate a vulnerable target. They have the health to survive the initial attack. They have the resources to sustain a fight. They have the damage and/or range to force dive heroes into a retreat, or even eliminate them as they run away.

**Comp Summary:** Low Mobility, Low Burst, Extended/Variable Range, High Sustain

# Brawler Comps

A Brawler comp fits in between dive and heavy comps. They're the final vertex of the ""rock-paper-scissors"" triangle that so many people use as an example of the type of balance that developers should strive for: ""everything should be strong against something, but equally weak against something else"".

They do not have the health pool to survive the initial dive. They have tools to engage in extended fights, but they're often too slow to truly be helpful when a fight breaks out. They're not mobile enough to get away, they put out higher damage than heavy comps, but not high enough to beat dive comps at their own game.

**Comp Summary:** Medium Mobility, Medium Burst, Medium Range, Medium Sustain

# What is a Counter?

I do understand that there are hard counters and soft counters, but I just want to focus on the overall concept of a counter itself. Healthy games can exist with hard counters or soft counters, but some combination of both must always be present in order to give players a problem to solve, as well as the tools they need to resolve it. If we look closely at the qualities I've outlined above, we can define the general idea of a counter like this:

>A counter is a strategy, character, or mechanic that **prevents** another strategy, character, or mechanic, from reaching their win condition.

A counter does not *stop* a character from reaching a win condition, it just makes it harder. How much of an obstacle a counter presents is where the discussion of hard vs soft counters begins, but I feel that is outside of the scope of this discussion.

Now that we understand the problem Brigitte was designed to solve, the strengths and weaknesses of a dive comp, and the purpose of a counter, we can finally talk about Brigitte herself.

# Brigitte: What She Should Have Been

Rather than summarize her entire history in this post, I'll reference her [launch day values](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/m5ogbv/brigittes_stats_at_launch_vs_current_day/) and [her patch history](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Brigitte) here, and I'd instead like to offer some ideas for a series of changes that the devs could have made to immediately address the problem they created while opening up design space to nerf or buff her with far less difficulty than they had.

**Brigette Patch Notes (Hypothetical):**

* Inspire has a radius of 15 meters
* Inspire heals allies at a rate of 40 health per second
* Inspire does not heal the shields or armor of a hero that has taken damage within the last 5 seconds
* Inspire's effect now lasts 2 seconds
* Repair Pack has a range of 20 meters
* Repair Pack applies 50 armor over an ally's current health
* Armor applied by Repair Pack is removed after 5 seconds
* Repair Pack holds a maximum of 2 charges
* Repair Pack regains a charge every 11 seconds
* Brigitte can now consume a Repair Pack to instantly restore 25 armor by holding her ability button
* Consuming a repair pack will cause Brigette to gain 5 armor per second for a maximum of 5 seconds
* Whip Shot now has a range of 25 meters
* Whip Shot has a cooldown of 10 seconds
* Whip Shot does 80 damage and knocks enemies back 8-10 meters
* Shield Bash's stun has been replaced with a push that launches enemies back 8-10 meters
* Shield Bash does 5 damage
* Shield Bash's cooldown has been reduced to 5 seconds
* Rally applies 850 armor to characters within Inspire radius 0.5 seconds after cast
* Armor granted by Rally remains at 850 for 0.5 seconds, then decays to 0 over the following 3 seconds

This looks like an overwhelming list of individual changes, but we can see a common idea emerge by looking at them as a group. While I used [the Overwatch wiki](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Overwatch_Wiki) for the rest of the values I was looking and understand that leads to an incomplete comparison, I believe that the ideas I present below can still be demonstrated effectively in spite of this:

* Inspire's 40 health per second is a lot of healing, but it is [20 points lower](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Winston) than Winston's Tesla Cannon and Brigitte now has no other way to heal her allies. Inspire's range is shorter, encouraging Brigitte and her allies to work closely in order to maximize their effectiveness. A duration of 2 seconds means that Brigitte must carefully decide when to leave one group of allies to triage another.
* Repair Pack no longer heals, instead providing 50 armor over whatever current health an ally has. A 20 meter range allows Brigitte to protect until she is able to reach them, meaning she isn't just useless if she can't heal through Inspire. Because the armor expires after 5 seconds, Brigette and her allies need to work together to find and support each other on the battlefield. 2 charges, and the ability to consume a charge to restore some of Brigette's armor, allow her to weigh the value of helping an ally against surviving to help her team.
* The changes to Whip Shot aren't a massive buff from where the ability started, but they make do help make up some of the strength she loses elsewhere. A 25 meter radius allows Brigitte to trigger Inspire if she is diligent in looking out for, and routing, enemies just before or as they dive, 80 damage allows her to remain a supportive threat alongside her allies. Combined with the changes to Shield Bash and Inspire, this ability can be adjusted in relation to the others in order to find the right balance of range, effectiveness, that would allow her to be an effective deterrent against dive without also being oppressive in the rest of the game.
* Shield Bash is where the real change in mindset occurs. Removing its stun and replacing it with a push changes its focus towards mobility and deterrence. It can now be used in combination with the rest of her kit to properly balance Brigitte's mobility, range, healing, protection, and the number of allies she is able to support at any given instance.
* The changes to Rally round Brigitte out. It is now a tool consistent with the idea of presenting obstacles to dive without shutting the door on their ability to counterplay. 850 armor allows a hero with 200 health to survive [D.va's Self Destruct](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/D.Va) with 50 health. Having the this armor decay to 0 over 3 seconds means, that it can't be used to absorb [an entire Dragonblade](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Genji). 0.5 seconds of startup, 0.5 seconds of full armor, and a 3 second decay to 0 means that Brigitte can't just react to an enemy voice line, use her ultimate, and let it take care of the problem automatically. She has to time and position her ability for maximum effectiveness against a Self Destruct, or decide whether she wants to use it against [Tracer's Pulse Bomb](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Tracer) or [Sombra's EMP](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Sombra).

These changes were all motivated by a desire to allow dive characters to have some opportunity to capitalize on an enemy's mistakes, or outwit their opponent, without removing Brigitte's ability to be effective against dive by protecting her allies from the onset of a dive and keeping enemies from closing the gap and entering their effective range.

# Additional Thoughts

Brigette demonstrates how a dev team can spend months nerfing a character, yet fail to bring her to a healthier place every time because they couldn't understand what was causing the problem. Brigitte had too many tools. Her abilities each had too much utility. You can't fix that by tweaking numbers. Looking outwards, this inability to properly identify a problem so that an effective solution can be implemented shows up everywhere in.

* Hanzo's [Scatter Arrow was replaced with Storm Arrows](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Hanzo) 2 years after Hanzo was released, yet players still have a love/hate relationship with those abilities.
* Symmetra received a new ability just one month after her release, but she was [completely reworked](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Symmetra) after 2 years. While her pick rate has gone up, I'm not sure it increased enough to justify the effort of her rework.
* Torbjorn received a [massive overhaul](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Torbjörn), and has arguably faired better than the previous two. He went from being a meme/troll pick to someone that actually offered enough to the team for players to seriously consider using him.

It shouldn't take 2 years to make significant changes to a hero when the players are voicing consistent concerns over standing problems. While it's true that these are just a handful of the more extreme examples, they [were not the first time](https://thegamehaus.com/overwatch/a-comprehensive-of-overwatch-metas-part-11-an-aussie-resurgence-and-the-moth-arrives/2020/01/18/) that significant changes caused more problems than they solved, and it won't be the last if the devs don't learn how to properly solve problems without causing more.

# Conclusion

Instead of designing fun character ideas and releasing them into the game without considering how they will affect it, then being forced to tweak every small detail of a character's statistics to bring them into alignment with the rest of the cast, the developers need to ask themselves the following questions before the decide to make a new character, and every time they wish to change a character:

* What is this hero supposed to do?
* How does this hero fit into the current state of the game?
* Can another hero be changed to do this better?
* Can I change other heroes so this hero has a reason to exist?
* Is the problem caused by my hero doing too much, or by this hero doing one thing too well?
* Will taking something away from this hero make it easier for me to fix them?

Otherwise, we only have to look at [the current version of Brigitte](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Brigitte) to see what happens when devs make changes that fix the way a character feels without understanding what they're supposed to do and how they achieve that goal. 

* She has kept the problematic stun that has prevented her from being balance properly
* Her Repair Packs are incapable of preventing an ally from surviving a dive, they can only heal an ally if they survive.
* Long range and low cooldown on her Repair Packs and Whip shot, as well as increased duration on Inspire and Rally mean that players have no real incentive to work closely with Brig to maximize each other's effectiveness.
* The low healing from Inspire, and weakness of her Barrier Shield, means that she can't traverse the battlefield effectively to triage allies, something she doesn't really need to do given the consistency and range of her Whip Shot and Repair Packs.

As a result, this version of Brigitte is much healthier for Overwatch than what the devs first released, but she has lost her identity. Succeeding with this version of Brigitte does not depend on making good decisions about her abilities. Succeeding with Brigitte depends on the enemy not being smart enough to avoid her stun and not having enough damage to overcome the heals she will always have on. Succeeding depends more on her allies being smart enough support *her*, instead of Brigette being capable of supporting them.

673,Reloading has almost zero effect on this game and i consider that to be a negative thing,"This is just a random thought i had, but after looking some things up and considering more things, i felt like it was worth making a post about it.

Reloading has (close to) zero effect on this game at all. Weapons have high enough clip sizes and low enough fire rates to make reloading change almost nothing.

I assume this is because the devs (and the community by extension) only really care about the cooldowns of abilities. Nobody ever calls a hero OP or weak because of their reload times, they judge their balancing (at least partially) by the cooldown times.

Have you *ever* heard somebody say ""Hold on, i need to reload""? If yes, you are a liar. Almost every weapon in this game takes 1-2 seconds to reload, it's abilities and ultimates that people have to manage.

The four worst offenders for irrelevant reloads in my opinion are Bastion, Orisa, Soldier 76 and Cassidy.

Bastion (In turret form) has a 300 bullet clip, fires at 35 bullets per second, and has a 2 second reload.That's 8.6 seconds of shooting for a 2 second reload.

2 Seconds.2 Goddamn seconds.

Im not here to critique Bastion's damage or overall balancing job, but that seems absolutely ridiculous. 2 Seconds would be the reload time for pistols in most games, not a huge 300 round minigun. You spend the vast majority of your time in turret mode shooting, almost NEVER needing to worry yourself with reloading.

Orisa is very similar, she has a 150 round clip that fires at 12.5 rounds per second or 12 seconds of shooting for a 2.66 second reload. You can spray away at enemies for 12 seconds and then only stop for less than 3 seconds to reload. Reloading has almost zero effect on your strategies or gameplay as Orisa.

Soldier 76 is just ridiculous. He has a 30 round clip and is SUPPOSED to have a 1.5 second reload. But if you dont already know, you can cancel half the goddamn reload animation and shorten it to 0.75 seconds. (Explained in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/6i7bem/a\_quick\_explanation\_on\_soldier\_reload\_cancels/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/6i7bem/a_quick_explanation_on_soldier_reload_cancels/))

A 0.75 second reload for a 30 round clip that fires at 8.66 shots per second. 0.75 Second reload for 3.4 seconds of shooting. With an ultimate that instantly reloads your clip and makes the reload cancel automatic.

Cassidy is the most disgusting offender to me. And i say this as a Cassidy main. This dude can shoot for 3 seconds for a 1.2 second reload, which isnt unreasonable. But you can shorten the reload slightly (I am not sure by how much) by punching or using flashbang as soon as the bullets hit the cylinder.

Then you have combat roll, which reloads your gun instantly. So now Cassidy can shoot for 6 seconds for a 1.2 second reload. But then you throw in high-noon, which ALSO instantly reloads your gun.  Whether you cancel the ultimate or shoot, it still reloads your gun instantly.

Cassidy is capable of firing his whole clip for 3 seconds, reloading instantly, firing for 3 more seconds, reloading instantly again, firing for 3 more seconds, and then shortening an already short reload.

The reason why i consider this a downside is because it doesnt effect balancing at all (Or at least in an extremely minor way). Why even bother having reloads at all? Orisa only has to stop her stream of bullets for 2.66 seconds every 12 seconds, at that point why not make her magazine size infinite?

Imagine if Dva just had a 100 round clip, with every round being a firing of her primary. And then imagine if she had a short-ass reload. That would be almost no different from her current infinite ammo. This ridiculous idea that almost every hero abides by has no reason to exist.  


Literally the only 2 heroes i can think of that reloading ever effects is Ashe and Roadhog, those are the only two heroes i ever notice the reload times on.

I genuinely hope reloading has more of an effect on strategies and gameplay in OW2, instead of being an incredibly minor thing that just interrupts your stream of bullets for an extremely short time every now and then."

This feature is completely useless to characters that don't have this feature and it seems like heroes in the future aren't going to use this feature either...so why not remove the feature and add the switch mechanic into their base kits? with Mercy it's simple, just make her reload button (which isn't used only for pistol) the button she uses to switch her weapon and maybe rework her gun to help enforce the change like making her gun have a resource meter instead of ammo.

704,The consequences of making Overwatch 2 a more “dynamic” game (Opinion piece),"(I originally posted this to the forums [in here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/the-consequences-of-making-overwatch-2-a-more-dynamic-game/640405) and I'm looking to spark discussion in a positive way about what makes Overwatch what it is and how it is moving forward)

Hi, I love Overwatch. I’ve been playing this game since release day and I want to paint a picture of what makes it so special to me; as Overwatch 2 hides just over the horizon promising massive changes, I can’t help but wonder if there’s a possibility that it will lose what makes it so unique and refreshing to many players.

Overwatch has been classed as different things by people throughout the years, having roots in team-based movement shooters and being a breath of fresh air for the class-based multiplayer genre as well. Many people would mention, also, that it features elements of MOBAs, which undeniably bring a big sense of variety that made Overwatch stand out amidst a plethora of less successful contemporaries.

Heroes in Overwatch weren’t necessarily tied to First Person-Shooter conventions, often bringing unusual playstyles and utility to the battlefield. Mei, Symmetra, Reinhardt and Winston would operate in a very different fashion, by exercising control via map awareness, resource management, utility, and mind games. Alongside those, Mercy, Lucio, Torbjorn and Zarya brought a spin to archetypes already seen in previous shooters while presenting fun new quirks and utilities as they expand on the legacy of those games, bending the traditions to fit more into the high-mobility, ability, and team-based nature of Overwatch.

A pattern visible with most of these characters is that they are very powerful in their specific niche, but not very versatile, leaning on their teammates to cover their weaknesses. This kind of hero is, however, often subject to criticism for requiring the enemy players to radically change their strategies in order to be counteracted when they set themselves up, as being only good at shooting might not be enough — Mercy (in the old days) would require you to chase her before damaging her allies, while Symmetra and Torbjorn create extra threats that halt progress and need to be dealt with.

In order to try to appease both audiences, Overwatch didn’t completely gut these heroes of what made them what they are, but at the same time (deliberately, as I want to guess) didn’t shy away from building some of the more popular characters into very versatile powerhouses. Heroes like Cassidy, Ashe, Hanzo, Widow and Ana can be played in essentially any environment, with their weaknesses being more subtle, as they have an option for every situation that they might encounter themselves in, and the ability to be effective at most ranges, while also providing impact through one-shots or highly crippling abilities.

We see and hear that in Overwatch 2 heroes will be reworked to be similarly more straightforward in how they help their team, by removing most stuns and making them survive less, but being more versatile and better at killing and dealing damage. While I understand the thrill of faster matches, I worry that something that made Overwatch so special might be lost: the idea of controlling a hero that felt completely unique in how they help their team and fulfilling a specific role or fantasy; be it giving life and soaring through the skies as Mercy, meticulously dividing the enemy team and controlling space as Mei or using your health bar and cooldowns as resource to calculate just how many absurdities you can get away with as Winston.

With the absence of those elements, Overwatch might become more homogeneous, and lean closer on conforming to the status quo of modern online multiplayer shooter games, becoming a more direct competitor to generally praised titles such as Apex and Valorant, but is that a good thing? It might be, for a lot of people, but it does feel bittersweet to observe the project change for the sake of costumers who, to put it bluntly, don’t like it that much for what it is. And on a similar vein, to watch it gatekeep players who have good strategies but aren’t as gifted with aim and reflexes — which, by the way, is already unnecessarily hard. Why does the bullet magnetism need to be non-existent and the hitbox for shots so tiny?

TL; DR: In short, before I stumble and make myself redundant, what I want to say is that I have enjoyed and enjoy Overwatch for its diverse MOBA-lite approach combined with the impact and feedback of a polished FPS. I worry that Overwatch will become a pure reflex-based FPS and its premise more homogeneous and generic by offering an experience that can already be found elsewhere, which might rob us of interesting concepts such as Sombra, Moira and Brig. If that makes more people happy than otherwise, then I suppose that’s ok, but I want to remind everyone of what could be lost in the meanwhile."

You aren't getting the game anytime soon, becuase Blizzard has been permanently outed as a dogshit company to everyone. From fucking up WoW and diablo, to sucking off China's liajang tower, despite countless crimes against humanity, to losing tons of employees (that were probabaly needed for the game development) after finding out the whole company is a sexual harassment nightmare. 

They aren't releasing the game because they are waiting for a miracle, of people forgetting this shit happened somehow, magically getting more employees and positive publicity before they are going to give you anything.

How many people in this sub actually understand that the company is fucked, and before any overwatch 2 becuase you want new heroes and all that, they are in need of a complete cleaning of house, and need a ton of people fired, a new mindset and everything else before any game gets made. This is much more important than just ""wheres my new heroes?"""

**Silver:** DPS has never lost a game and never will. If healers and tanks were better then we'd win.

749,"Overwatch 2 Reputation, Delay and Development of the Game Currently (Opinion / Discussion)"," 

With Overwatch 2 being [delayed](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760118/activision-blizzard-delays-overwatch-2-and-diablo-4-again) it has brought many people to vent their [frustration](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/as-a-former-apologist-i-have-lost-hope/640054) with the lack of content with Overwatch. 

This is an opinion of a person who is completely biased on Overwatch. Please be respectful when discussing views and other opinions :)

Like everyone else I am disappointed that Overwatch has been delayed for an unknown amount of time however, why is everyone slamming their keyboards? I've probably seen the same rant about ""IVE LOST ALL MY FAITH IN OVERWATCH"" or ""SEE?"" posts. Having the community outraged about the delay does not do anything to speed up the process. If the community got what they wanted the new game in 2022 and it turns out to be trash what happens? It is an endless loop of hate. Whatever the developers and team do, it is worthless. I disagree. I do not want the game to be rushed, come out worse than expected as [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2021/2/20/cyberpunk-2077-great-game-hiding-underneath-buggy-unpolished/) did...

I agree that Overwatch had the potential to keep releasing new content and new heroes and new maps but maybe there is a reason why they stopped. Overwatch's current and only main monetisation in-game is through loot boxes. In this current time, loot boxes are outdated and mostly hated upon by news media. With the ease with which players can earn the in-game currency most of us can end up getting the skins in events in the game without the use of real money. Overwatch's loot box monetisation system is being out-competed by newer monetisation methods in other games. Compared to Valorant if you want a gun skin bundle that will be $100+. Or apex legends with \~$10 for their battle pass. Overwatch has none of this and if the team did implement this feature into the game right now I am sure that many people would disagree with the decision. How does Valorant get away with every new gun skin bundle \~$100 while Overwatch is expected to release new heroes, new maps, stories, lore and animation with loot boxes which no one buys? A solution that Overwatch 2 is trying to solve is to make a new way into earning money so they can do literally what people want. As much as people beg Overwatch is not going to be able to make constant content if they do not have the constant revenue to rely on. 

The ""long development times"" of Overwatch 2 and lack of communication around what is PVP and PVE lacks. Hold on I need to search up how long does it take to make a game... oh wait 3 to 5 years? So considering Overwatch 2 had just started being made in 2018 that is only 3 years of work. Here is an example of A GAME taking its own time and being unique and high quality. [Persona 5](https://gamerant.com/persona-5-long-development-persona-6/) took 9 years to complete and release. Persona 5 was announced in late 2013 and released in 2016. Overwatch is similarly in the same boat as Persona 5 and it would be sad for Overwatch to be forcefully released unpolished. Whilst we still do not understand everything that is coming to PVE, it is expected to have story missions. I would expect a complete story of what is going to happen in the future of Overwatch and Null Sector which probably is already a lot of content needed to be made. It was previously stated that these stories would have an intro and outro cut scene for each story. We should also consider the current [Blizzard Lawsuit](https://georgiastatesignal.com/the-blizzard-lawsuit-and-its-consequences/) as many staff and important members of the Overwatch team have left which could have impacted these delays. 

Miscommunication and the absence of communication may be a factor of the huge hate and negativity of news about Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 is giving players who currently do have Overwatch more content to PVP yet players see it as just a new mode. Jeff Kaplan did challenge [this perspective](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxSP6x2oetB8txIchCOjdkHhRXj4JKUvkn).

As Overwatch 2 reaches its final release date, I hope that it can generate some hype and bring more content to Overwatch.

Please just give Overwatch 2 and Team 4 a fair chance before repeating the same hive-minded opinion of the internet about what is wrong and right. As Jeff Kaplan said ""please take care of the overwatch team. they are wonderful, caring, brilliant people and they need you right now.""

Among the list of leaked games is Overwatch 2 with an estimated release date of 12/1/2022. Could a 2022 launch still be feasible? I think that would still constitute their earnings call language of ""planning for a later launch than originally envisaged""?

Maybe I'm on copium, but I still think a 2022 launch could still be in the cards. The full list of leaked titles can be viewed here: [https://web.archive.org/web/20211103180922/https://gist.github.com/woctezuma/a1252976913713390963b745fbc51e73](https://web.archive.org/web/20211103180922/https://gist.github.com/woctezuma/a1252976913713390963b745fbc51e73)"

761,"I hope for more OW2 delays-I love OW1, just the way it is","So I did some digging, turns out OW2 is NOT on a new engine, just an updated one, for PvE. Meaning skins should carry over very easily? So voicelines and skins will keep coming. That’s all I want. Because I don’t want OW2.

Hot take:  
I like the current meta, I like the state of every hero in the game(though bastion needs some love), and I like being an off tank, not hard front lining. Slow patches? Just gives me more time to refine my playing on the current patch. No events? I only play comp anyway. I don’t want to relearn every hero when they rework every hero. Nope.

I know I’m in the minority, and this is mainly because I have a huge appreciation of the game and don’t take what I got for granted, after moving away 10fps and 200ping, climbing from 700sr. This game is fun, man. >1.5k hours in, even when there’s smurfs, man, this game is so fun. Just the other week, I was depressed thinking about how my off tank role would be going away, and how I plan to become a widow main instead of playing a weird frontliney main tanky dva. And lo and behold, OW2 delay! Happy day. This game just gets funner as I climb. Yeah, there’s lotsa new accounts and smurfs as I pass through plat(much more than in gold), but c’mon, it’s so much less compared to bronze!

  
And I recently found my footing in my collegiate team and got into diamond again! Sure, there may be toxic people in comp, but I don’t hear em as I rank up with my teammates in a discord call. I rediscovered peeling being a joy to do, as I do it for supports I genuinely care about. Eating gravs isn’t glanced over. Comms are full. I look forward to every game, from soloq to organized scrims.

  
So, basically, Overwatch;

763,"What if instead of 5v5, we had more than 3 roles","Guys hear me out. Double shield was a problem. And obviously not having many tank or support options is bad compared to the number of dps heroes. So here is my proposition. We keep 6v6, but now we have a Main Tank role, an Off-Tank role, a Main-Support role, an Off-Support role.

If you queue for Tank, one tank has to pick Main the other has to pick Off. They can switch during the game but there has to be one Main one Off. Same with support. And you just have a pool of dps.

I think this system would support diverse strategies (assuming we get a ton of new tanks and supports), make matches a whole lot more balanced, eliminate the need for 5v5 in my opinion, which is apparently slowing down production of OW2 a lot since they have to rebalance everyone. We get to keep 2 tank combos which is a lot of fun. Plus I think 6v6 chaos is what makes OW. What do you guys think? Is this dumb?

Tl;dr: My solution to the Overwatch problem is, adding a ton of tanks and supports. Splitting the Tank and Support roles into two (Main and Off) each have to be selected in every game. And we keep 6v6."

I see other games like Destiny 2, Apex Legends, Black Ops Cold War, Fortnite, Minecraft, and many, many more getting consistent content drops that mean something to their playerbase. Yeah Overwatch’s team is working on another game, but that doesn’t mean you let your current game rot in the depths of Roadhog’s dungeon.

Please, Blizzard. Put some real effort forth. Release some part of Overwatch 2, or just give Overwatch the second game’s maps and heroes. Give us SOMETHING new that isn’t cosmetics.

But just for a second, just take a look at whatever Blizzard is even doing:

- Deathmatch map after deathmatch map, because there's no need for fine tuning (any new map would have to work with OW2 comp logic)

- If there's any possibility of a new hero, it'll already be tuned to work with OW2 logic (yes, I know about the ""sliders"" comment the devs made), but OW2 teamplay is different from OW1 (remember the experimental patch?)

- Lead Devs leaving (which should always be a sign in game development that something is wrong)

What's to say that they even hold anything that could relate to OW1 anymore?

Like, give me your opinions (hell, tell me I'm wrong even) but do y'all really think they can still update OW1 after going so far in OW2 (In terms of 5v5, reworks, OWL, etc)?"

808,"Should OW/OW2 go for a F2P business model like Fortnite, etc. instead of a single time purchase in order to support constant content updates?","The main complaint right now about OW is lack of content updates. But is this really surprising for a game with OWs business model of being a single time purchase? These single purchase games make most of its money for the first few years. But now that everyone has a copy of the game, no one is buying new copies. They're not making money anymore, such that they cant support working on new content. When this initial money dries up, so does the ""free"" content updates, just small balance fixes here and there. Now it's time to develop an expansion or a sequel, which is what they're doing right now. They're working on updates but they're not gonna give it away for free. It's been 5 years since release, and 2 years since OW2 was announced (which is really just 1 year because of COVID). So the expansion/sequel timing is just about right.

**Now in hindsight, would you have wanted for OW to have and F2P business model like Fortnite, Apex Legends, COD Warzone, other multiplayer games?**

This would mean minimal free loot boxes and gold earned during normal gameplay. (As opposed to the very generous system OW currently has). Everything would have to be bought with real money - loot boxes, gold, skins, emotes, highlight intros, other cosmetics, golden weapon (?), other weapon skins (?), maps (?), PVE missions (?), and other micro transactions.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** OW is a single purchase game, it doesn't make money constantly. That means it won't have unlimited free content updates. They will stop making content and will have to make sequels/expansions to sell content for money. If OW is F2P, then it can continuously release updates on a regular basis without stopping.

813,"Just did a solo team kill, feeling good",
814,This is a finished game...in a good way,"I've seen a lot of discussion about OW dying or being already dead but I consider OW is a finished and settled game,and a damn good end product.There is no other fps as colorful,varied and customizable as OW in my opinion.
Yes,we don't get any significant updates to encourage old players staying but there's is already a lot of content (game modes,maps, cosmetics,heroes and even Pixar quality short stories) to keep you entertained for a couple of hours alone or with friends.
I consider the content we have to be really good (and better/more varied than most fps),yes OW is a finished game,an excellent finished game that I will keep playing not because is new but because is good."
815,"The delay isn't the problem, it's that you gave up on us too fast Blizz. OW1 NEEDS a few more maps and character drops to hold us over.",
816,Why can’t they just improve OW1?,"As everyone knows OW2 won’t be coming out until 2023 or later due to the many issues blizzard is facing. I don’t understand why they are still trying to make OW2. The game will be very similar in its base design the only difference being 5v5, a story mode and more heroes. THEY SHOULD JUST ADD THESE CHANGES TO OW2!!! The game is at a cross road. If they don’t add any new game play changing content then the game will die and when OW2 eventually releases in the coming YEARS the player base will still be extremely low. They should just add all the planned changes to OW1 instead of making an whole new game. 

I know that it’s probably not that easy but one thing they definitely could do is stop working on pve and start focusing on pvp in the live game to help keep their current game from being put 6 feet under. Because let’s face it. 99% of people who are going to play OW2 when it comes out are going to mainly play it for the awesome pvp that we loved about OW1 when it was good."
817,My expirience on soldier from TF2 gives me an advantage,
818,In the canal,
819,You can silence Torbjorn's gun by swapping to hammer immediately after shooting,
820,Free coaching,"Hey everyone typically I do free Overwatch coaching on Monday and Tuesday, but today I have some free time and I will be doing coaching at 4pm CST

I have been coaching for a year now and I have help many people climb to new ranks and develop better game sense all around

I am a tank main and specialize in main tank but I can and have coached every role from bronze to GM

If you’re interested in getting better and learning more about the game then join my stream and discord today to submit a VOD! Again today I’ll coach at 4pm CST

Honestly I think the greatest casualty of the 5v5 format change is not the other tank (tho that sucks) but the fact none of the new heroes can be released in the current format because they are most likely built from the ground up for 5v5."
827,Implement Lucioball as a normal playable game mode,"In my opinion Lucioball is a very fun mode and probably one of the better event games and now after OW2 was delayed even further they could at least act like they have new content, through implementing old content but as a constant playable mode + his comp version"

831,My first clean Nanoblade on PC,
832,Becoming what I swore to destroy,
833,The Overwatch community rn if they have to wait even longer for an update,
834,"I don't see why Overwatch 2 being ""delayed"" is such a massive problem","Overwatch 2 is not COD. It's not a brainless remix of the same crap every single year. Overwatch requires a great deal of balancing. A lot of people are highly sceptical of the change to 5v5, it may not seem like a massive change, but it is.

People seem to forget that Overwatch 2 is going to be a whole new game, **NOT AN EXPANSION PACK.**

When people first saw Overwatch 2 in 2019, many comments stated ""it's the same game"".

Do you want Overwatch 2 to just be Overwatch 2.0 but with 5v5? Or do you want them to take the time to truly evolve the game?

Give it time, if they feel they need to delay it, then respect that. 

P.S. When did Overwatch 2 have an official release date? Has it really been delayed?"
835,OW should have some crazy character cross-overs to keep people playing,"Hearing about the delay and a possible 2023 release for Overwatch 2, I kinda thought to myself that it would be cool to have some crazy cross-overs in Overwatch, as events, apart from the regular ones which are kinda nostalgic but we went through those a lot of times and they tend to get boring now. 

Since we'll most likely be stuck with the same stuff for the next year, and - as Flats mentioned in his recent clip - the views are dropping down like crazy - perhaps some unusual stuff could happen just to keep the game alive to an extent in the future?

&#x200B;

Wouldn't it be cool to see heroes from other games in OW? Just a regular quickplay game with some characters out of this world, overpowered, never seen in OW before. For fun. Take Marvel heroes for example:

* Iron Man - HP/Armor 50/50, can fly inifintely until armor is gone, regular and charged ""reeeee"" shots, homing missles as ultimate, basically a Pharah/Echo on steroids
* Captain America: unbreakable shield but can only melee in close range, extra speed and agility, just like a nano-Rein/Brigitte from previous seasons but without a charge and he could do this all day
* Spider-Man: web swing (duh), web shots, huge spider web slowing down opponents as an ult, so a Widow/Mei mashup
* Thor: Mjolnir in close range and as a projectile, leaping, calling Stormbreaker as his ult, so like a Winston DPS thing
* Thanos: snaps and deletes half of red team, lol

Wouldn't care about those kinda heroes being overpowered or underdeveloped, it would just be a limited time event. Just one basic skin and pose, some basic and classic voicelines and I would be hooked.

I've already seen some amazing Marvel vs Overwatch artworks on this subreddit and it just made me think what if we could see such things in the future? I'm fine with DC, doesn't matter - perhaps seeing something unexpected and unusual since 2016 would increase the player base yet again.

&#x200B;

It's probably not gonna happen ever but I just had this thought and wanted to share it with you guys. 

And excuse my English, just in case. 

Thanks!"
836,"""Fan content"" event?","What if we get a new yearly event which theme is ""fan content""?

I know, most games don't do that due to it being somehow disrespectful to the developers and the people who actually come with the content from within the company, but what if this becomes something once a year?


What I mean about it is both:
- a gamemode gets promoted from game browser to the arcade
- 6 fan-made skins that gets promoted to the game


That'd give us much more content a year than only skins and would be something fun to happen, not to mention that it's very great improving tool for the devs-players relationship

I don't have a content but I do wanna ask you all about the content I'm thinking about"

I'm Austin I've always liked talking with and meeting people in the overwatch community learning what each of you are passionate about, so I thought I'd ask each of you, what ""Side"" character out of all the ones that have been introduced so far is your favorite? Any that you absolutely love?

For me if it isn't Obvious it's D.mon from MEKA squad ever since 2018 when the D.va short dropped I've always been hoping she'd get in her past with D.va genuinely intrigues me as does the comments Micheal chu made about her being the Tough and protective member and as a D.va main I'd Love to have a more durable ""Tanky"" tank to play, since then I've gotten countless art pieces made of her for fun and for streams I've speculated on her abilities and she even inspired my online name Dmonic

844,Reported for a filtered word?,"I was upset and something came out. I was reported for saying a word, even though it was filtered by the system. The word could've been anything since all the letters were censored into asterisks, so I don't get how the report could actually go through. Apparently I had the relaxed word filter on, but I'm pretty sure words get filtered before they're even sent - and some messages get dropped no matter what if they contain certain unspeakable words.

So, I'm afraid of what'll happen. Does anyone know the logic behind the chat system in Overwatch?"

851,"I can't climb as tank, I don't think it's my fault. It could be though, what can I do better, and is it really me or just the matchmaking rng?","I've been on a 8 game streak of win, then lose, then win, then so on. I can't climb because I just keep losing the 30 sr I just won. I don't think it is my fault either as tank. I play rein, I'm playing really well around the corner, I can get picks or ram into their team with my hammer swinging due to how scattered they are and then either two things happen. My dps follow up and clean the team, or they somehow die out of position far away from our team. It just feels like i'm rolling a dice on getting good or bad teammates. I protect my dps with my shield but my shield is breaking faster so I play around corners and keep it regenerating above 600 - 400 health so it's never on cooldown. My dps get picked first or our healers or something like that that is out of my hands. People say, if your good, you can solo carry a bad team. I think they are just dumb. You can't 4v6 even a slightly coordinated team with a bad dps. They just roll yours or roll you trying to make a big play. At one point a rein playing against me didn't even hold his shield up at the choke and walked through swinging without taking any damage, with my whole team behind me."

869,"Overwatch 2 is delayed. I don't feel mad about it, let me tell you why","Hello there

I started playing Overwatch one year and 2 months ago. So by todays standards I'm a new-ish player. Even though the honeymoon phase for this game is over for me I still enjoy it. I've met two amazing people over the game which resulted in a friendship domino effect where these two people brought their circle of friends into mine which ended up expanding it and making it better. 

I realize how OW2 getting delayed (again) is a major issue to the point where some players might even drop the game until OW2 releases but I feel very differently. I still have goals to achieve in OW and maybe a lot of you already did everything you planned so you feel as if there needs to be something new. However in my opinion Overwatch is still a good game. 

Let me explain. This now ""dead"" game is the same game it was during it's prime. Sure some stuff changed but the overall gameplay is still fun. There might not be many new things happening since the release of Echo but I feel they might start releasing new heroes into OW 1 because of the delay. And when we break it down that's 99% of why people think the game is dying. No new heroes. We still get regular updates, events and new skins and cosmetics. So while there might be a lot of stuff that people more experienced than me could tell me are wrong about the game all I see atm is a bunch of people being butthurt only because there are no new heroes being released. 

Trust me, coming from a game like Paladins where sometimes 2 new heroes would be released in a span of 3 months it's not what you want."

What really caught my interest thought was how intense these guys got trying to find something better than Hole for a ship name and here’s a few I found and peoples reaction to it.

CONZO- people thought it sounded cool until someone googled it. It apparently is slang for a creepy stalker that is also attractive so it was a no go.

HASSIDY- people thought it was fine, but ‘plain’ apparently 

YEEHAN- Honestly don’t know why they waited this long to go with this, this is beautiful. Not sure if Mcree ever says YeeHaw in the games but I think that’s just schematics 

CASSIMADA- people thought it was alright, too long to say.

HANOLE- Pronounced like the work Cannoli it’s fun to say, kind of shitposty though

914,Flex is the new tank... What about a real flex queue ?,"I've been playing that game for a (very) long time now... I think I can speak for a majority of us when I say waiting in queue is a pain, I get that and I live that. So ... I flex... yet being flex nowadays means being a tank 90% of the time.

Let's be honnest and stand with facts. I play around 2300- 2500 SR in every role but when I solo queue DPS, I have to play with 2 off tanks here to deal damages. I also have to suffer a Zen or a Moira here to deal damages as well 'cause ""*Hey! Why the h\*\*\* would I wait that long when I can queue heal or tank and play dps anyway!*""...

So what's new? Its basically a 6 dps comp' all over again. But some of us have to wait sometimes up to 18 minutes for that ...! (You feel it even better when a leaver comes in the way...)

**What about a real flex queue ?** Uh ?

Here is how I see it and this is my opinion ... maybe you can relate to that, maybe not ...

The problem with 3 queues and 3 distinct SR is it means for too many players 1 SR to be serious about, and 2 SR to queue faster without caring that much about the outcome of the game. So...

Why dont we have a real flex queue where we still have to play 2-2-2 BUT with random roles and only ONE SR? A **real** SR that every flex players would care about. No matter if you have to play tank, dps or healer, we would all have to do our best to reach a better SR.

Maybe throwers would still throw, but I think the number of opportunities to play a better game would improve cause I really think only ONE SR in ranked games would give it more value.

I was thinking a bit about why Jeff Kaplan has been silent about what went on behind the scenes with the overwatch team and the real reason why he left. It occurred to me that of course _he's probably still under an NDA_ \*facepalm\*  


So with that in mind, I'm wondering if anyone knows the end date of his NDA or if someone familiar with Blizzard contracts in the overwatch teams has an idea about how long that NDA might be?

Once we know that, we can probably find out when we might start to hear information from Jeff or some games journalists to shed some light on what really went on and Jeff's decision making process assuming it has nothing to do with the scandal that rocked blizzard as a whole."

Diamond gun. You get a single one. It will go to the hero you have the most playtime on in competitive. 

Do you think it would be:
- good, as it is a nice flashy way to show off on your main, as well as say to others “hey. I got this. Look. This is my most played hero.”
- bad, as it could lead people to playing a non-opportune hero just to show off their diamond gun (even though everyone has one), as well as when you play another hero people may say “it’s not your diamond gun. You might be throwing or playing a hero you don’t know how to play as well. Play your main.”

Do you think the later could be fixed by maybe having 3 diamond guns for the 3 most played? 

Or do you think maybe there needs to be some secondary qualification that could make it more special and maybe not everyone has one."

944,Best thing I've done with Ana in 5 years,
945,"As a Support, how to play around when my Mercy is a healbot?","In my experience, healbotting Mercy usually pockets the Tanks and that means she will also be robbing ult charges. My DPS teammates are likely to struggle since they can't outmatch an enemy who's heavily enabled unless they are godtier, able to be self-sufficient.

Mercy is the best enabler for DPS, but I can't think what other Supports are best fit for enabling DPS. Ana/Baptiste/Moira pump a lot of heals and they are good if my DPS don't move a lot. If they pick dives/flying heroes, picking Baptiste/Moira is mostly out of question. For Ana, it really tests my aim and perhaps I should focus on landing more anti-heals.

Brigitte's Repair Packs / Zen's Harmony orb enable the dives greatly but their heals are quite limited. Playing Brig also requires me to get in range and whip enemies in order to keep my inspire up. Zen is hard to stay alive if the enemy team also run dives unless my teammates peel me well. (I mostly switch off Zen immediately if the enemy team has Doomfist/Sombra. Zen's matchups against either or them are so unfavorable until they're played by braindead players.)

Picks Lucio may be good but Lucio + Mercy duo is generally hated. Mercy + any low heal Support isn't very ideal unless my teammates select self-reliant heroes (e.g Roadhog, Soldier:76, Mei, Sombra). In my experience, low heal comp works primarily because my DPS + fat DPS (e.g Roadhog, Sigma) pop off amazingly as healing doesn't matter when enemies are dead, meanwhile enemies are not very coordinated and capable enough to counter our Roadhog / Doomfist / Hanzo / Widowmaker who's constantly picking them off."

Oh, yeah, you get some extra xp for backfill, but yeah, who cares about that. The priority que is nice, but that only partially makes up for it when it happens so often. I think it should be weighted so that those who leave games early not only get an xp penalty (meh, who cares), and get temp banned for a bit (many people have multiple accounts), but also make it so when they que for arcade/quick play, they get put into a special que that makes them wait for a backfill spot for 5 minutes, then they can get into the normal que.

Now imagine we also made it so that these bubbles had a cooldown of let's say five seconds and that we made it so that Zaraya's beam also in addition to having a subtle pull to it would cool down the bubbles by 1 second for a successful kill on an opponent and her ultimate (which you should make the pull bigger absolutely, just massive and have it do a crap ton of damage - way more than it does right now) would cool down the bubbles by 2 percent for a successful kill on an opponent.

Think of it like Lamar Jackson. His QB stats and comp % is pretty damn good, but how much does his legs open up the passing lane for him? The defense have to commit one extra person in the box to stop his running, which opens up all kind of passing lanes for him.

I do know that Curry floater and finger roll game is damn good though.""

10,[HoopsHype] Out-of-rotation players who could become trade candidates,">Goran Dragic being in Toronto has less to do with him as a player and almost everything to do with being the necessary salary filler in the Kyle Lowry sign-and-trade. Dragic has only appeared in the first four games of the season averaging only 15.5 minutes per game. The Raptors stopped playing him with the emergence of rookie 6-7 point guard Dalano Banton. who has also overtaken second-year guard Malachi Flynn in the rotation. Trading Dragic will be no easy task as his large salary complicates any deal. Surely a buyout is in consideration, but they’ll likely hold onto him through the trade deadline in case a deal comes. Even if there isn’t a team interested in trading for Dragic’s contract, it could be used as part of a larger deal where his new team potentially buys him out if they aren’t an ideal situation for him.

>Marvin Bagley has only appeared in one game for 10 minutes out of Sacramento’s 12 regular-season games so far. His absence from the rotation was expected after his representation posted a tweet blasting the Kings for the decision. They have about four other backup centers who could make this list with their inconsistent roles, but Bagley has the biggest pedigree of them. Like Dragic, the Kings will likely also hold onto him through the deadline in case a trade comes. Sacramento could use his $11 million salary as ballast to match for a player who can help them get back into the playoffs for the first time in 16 seasons.

>The signing of Robin Lopez was curious considering they already had two young centers in Wendell Carter Jr. and Mo Bamba to prioritize. Lopez has appeared in five of Orlando’s six first regular-season games averaging 12 minutes per game and has not played since. Mo Wagner has also passed him in the rotation and the Magic getting healthier won’t help Lopez either. His $5 million salary is both very tradeable and manageable as a dead cap hit in case Orlando decides to buy him out.

19,What will James Wiseman's role be when he returns?,It's pretty clear last year the Warriors were terrible with him on the court. Do you think they'll make better use of him or will they just trade him instead?

21,What's your first NBA memory?,I was curious about this from another thread but mine is when I was 5 and the grizzlies and mavs played in the playoffs in like 2006. I was watching the game and I think the grizzlies lost by a lot. Just curious

23,is there any chance ben and KAT get traded to the same team?,"ben simmons is obviously gonna get traded at some point, and with the wolves’ yet again disappointing record, i’ve heard talks of them blowing it up and moving karl-anthony towns. some have seen these talks and tried to make trades where they’re being traded to separate teams in 3 team deals, but i was under the impression the whole idea of ben to the wolves was so he could play with kat. my thought was maybe there was a trade that could land them both on the same team. all i could come up with, though, was both going to the warriors with klay to the sixers and poole, wiseman, kuminga, and moody + picks to the wolves. this, of course, relies on the sixers believing klay will come back and play at least near all star level, and the wolves being willing to part with kat for high potential players who haven’t shown much and poole. seems like an easy win for the warriors and a loss for the other two, but i can’t come up with much better"
24,What are some iconic NBA moments that most people forgot?,"For me, it's Chris Bosh's block on Dammy Green in Game 6 of the 2013 Finals, although the main reason for that is that there was a much more iconic moment in the very same game. What are some iconic moments that you don't think get enough recognition?"

Lakers have 0.","**Edit: the data set I had didn't account for draft day trades. To get a more accurate picture, I have added a new table switching the ""drafted by"" metric to instead check for the first team the player played for.**

I was curious about this yesterday so ran some numbers.

Other observations:

* Rockets, Pacers and Heat have the most undrafted players with 8.
* Adding their self-drafted (8) and undrafted (5) players, Warriors have the lowest number of players who were drafted elsewhere – just 4.
* Lakers not holding on to a single draft pick is pretty crazy.
* There are way more undrafted players in the leage than I had expected – over 20%. Although I guess 2-way contracts skew this by a lot.
* There doesn’t really seem to be any correlation of any of this with win-loss record or championship odds.

He led the league in points and steals, played all 82 games while averaging 40 min per game.","In 1986-87, Michael Jordan had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history; he became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league-high 37.1 points on 48.2% shooting. In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became  the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season.

The next year, Jordan again led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting and won his first league MVP Award. He was also named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year.

While LeBron’s cavs were struggling to even make it to the playoffs (we got bounced in the second round by Detroit) Obviously LeBron was having a career year but as some of the greats said “it don’t mean a thing without a ring” so was D Wade considered a better player and higher all time or did everyone recognize that Heat team was stacked?
42,Udonis Haslem - still in the NBA at 41,"Wow what an interesting career - He's played in 48 games since the start of the 2016 season, and yet he's still chugging along.  This is now his 19th season, all with MIA, and what I find fascinating is that his career earnings are just $68.1 million.  That's an average of just $3.6 million per year, and his highest salary for a season was only $7.1 million.  

There was like a 7 year stretch where Haslem was a 10 and 8 guy, and I just have to wonder if there were ever any better offers that came in.  

I don't know, I just find it odd that Haslem, who has always been a solid but otherwise unspectacular player, is the guy who sticks around with the same team until he's 41.  I'm sure the fact that his team is MIA plays a major role (the Spurs are the only other team I can think of who would consider keeping a guy around that long), but he's the oldest player in the league by 4 years.  I also have to wonder how many more years he's got in the tank!"

45,Anthony Edwards or Jalen Green?,"Even though he was a lower pick, Jalen Green was seen as a better prospect coming into the league, than Edwards was the previous season. These are 2 guys that fall in the same arche-type of player (young, uber-athletic scoring guard, with great positional size). 

But, considering Edwards' recent strides (and growth spurt), if you had to choose today, who do you see as the better prospect between the 2 shooting guards? And who would you pick for your team?"

Not necessarily greater offensive player (ofc Curry) but who has more facets to their arsenal in offense.

MVPG13 is making an undeniable top 5 MVP case right now since he now has the team record to go along with a remarkable statistical season including playing some elite defense

63,Paul George for DPOY?,"Every Clippers game I've watched, Paul George has played excellent defense. He's currently leading the Clippers to a top 5 defense, should there be noise for PG to win Defensive Player of the Year?

After Ben Wallace was inducted to the Hall of Fame in September,  every former Championship team has at least one member in the HOF."
72,"Hypothetically, it would be interesting if the league not only punished players for getting off the bench during scuffles, but also punished players for trying to break up scuffles on the court.","Every single NBA skirmish is the same. No one really wants to fight. Two guys get involved, often times there's not even physical contact and if there is it is minimal, but then there is a sudden rush of everyone else on the court coming to try to break it up but really they're all just escalating it. One guy grabs another guy to hold him back, but then someone grabs the guy that just grabbed the guy, and then someone grabs that guy...it just tumbles out of control over and over again.   

I'd rather see two guys get into it, and literally no one move a muscle. No one's coming to the rescue. No one's saving anyone. And then we'd just see two guys who don't really wanna fight just not fight."

He put up 21/8/5

including 5 offensive rebounds, which is insane for a 6'1 player"
82,[Swanson] The Clippers will be giving away 10k to one fan at each game for the rest of the month of November,"The Clippers will be giving away 10k to one fan at each game for the rest of the month of November

In order to enter the contest, Fans have to be in the arena at least 15 minutes before tip off and wearing Clippers' colors to be eligible to win. The team describes it as an attempt to make ""fashionably late"" unfashionable, basically.

83,The Raptors current roster construction might not work,"So with Siakam coming back permanently there is a bit of a problem, they have 3 fowards they need to start.

Obviously the choice was to start Siakam at C and play with a lineup of FVV,GTJ,Scottie,OG and Siakam but this lineup has been getting killed on the boards and havent been performing well.  

Its only a small 2 game sample however if this problem drags on what do they do? All 5 of them are too instrumental to the team to just bench. The first choice that comes to mind for people is GTJ but he is quite literally playing like a DPOY guard and leading the league in assists and is one of their most reliable shot creators. Even if they bench GTJ it doesnt fix the problem of 3 fowards. Scottie is in the ROTY campaign and is their most impactful player on the court alot of the times during games and OG,FVV and Siakam are the core of the Raptors team and are the guys getting paid."
84,What young player is tyrese maxey comparable in value to?,"Thought I'd take advantage of recency bias to make this thread. I imagine he's easily less valuable than the top 4 of the 2021 draft. He's probably worth less than suggs and haliburton, right? Who is he comparable to?"
85,"People on r/nba pick Mobley over Barnes, but many NBA players have praise for Barnes and no one has the same level of praise for Mobley. Why is this?","I asked a question about who you would rather have and the answer was overwhelmingly Mobley. However, many NBA players have praised Barnes and how nba ready he is. Perkins just tweeted out that Barnes should've gone #1. Meanwhile, no one has said anything about Mobley. Why is there such a large disconnect between r/nba and actual nba players?"

89,Sabonis’ play so far this season,"So I’ve watched quarters of Pacers games here and there this season, tonight being the first FULL game aside from their opener, and the thing sorta popping out to me is that Sabonis doesn’t seem like quite the same guy. I understand he’s up against Gobert tonight, but even going up against lesser defenders he just seems a little shakey with his shot. His counting numbers are sorta the same as usual, but something seems a little off. If you’ve watched more than me, tell me if I’m wrong"
90,2020 Heat vs 2021 Bucks who wins a seven game series?,Just thought of this as the 2021 bucks were a improved team and our 2020 team was pretty good. Just wondering who y’all think would win in a 7 game series and why?
91,What team does Ben Simmons make sense for?,"We talk a lot about Ben, but what team could actually use his skill set? Good defense point forward who’s great in transition but bad in the half court. I’m not talking about what trade makes sense just where does he even go?"
92,When does Adam Silver intervene in the Ben Simmons situation?,"Simmons is currently setting an extremely blatant precedent that the shield of ""mental health"" can be used to sit out indefinitely, on a new contract, to force a trade. Simmons doesn't even *need* a trade, he can simply collect paychecks for 4 years and retire comfortably. 

As of now it seems that the Sixers have no legitimate means of recourse. Will the league allow Simmons and Klutch to continue with their current plot? Or are they afraid of stigmatizing legitimate mental health concerns?"

97,Does the 76ers impressive play without Embiid make Morey trade Ben Simmons for lower value or make him more adamant to get higher value?,"Does the 76ers impressive play without Embiid make Morey trade Ben Simmons for lower value or make him more adamant to get higher value? The 76ers have been impressive without Embiid even though they lost some games and look competitive without their star. Maxey and Korkmaz have had big jumps and Niang and Drummond have been great acquistitons so far. Does Morey go for a lower value trade for someone of McCollum or Hield quality and some other pieces, or does this make Morey believe that they can get a perennial all-star to to come to their team for one of these breakout players and picks."
98,Is there a metric anywhere that uses data to show how much the average player or team complains to refs?,I had a random thought last night watching the Laker game about how often certain players complain potentially costing them points by not getting back on defense. Wanted to see if anyone in this sub may have checked up on this too to see throughout the league which players complain the most and how it may effect their team in transition.

116,Does anyone like the Cavaliers branding?,"I think it’s so ugly and needs a total rebrand. 

They have fun players but the ugly brown + ugly yellow makes none of their games an enjoyable experience. They’re only fun to watch when they’re wearing whites or blacks - does anyone else agree that they should scrap the full brown kit + arena and go for different colors? Man it’s UGLY"
117,How do you guys feel about Ben Simmons in Boston?,"I was just thinking based off the other post about how a Simmons to to Celtics trade would go and honestly I don't hate it.

Obviously, the deal would have to include one of either Tatum or Brown and I think you could make a case for a straight swap for either one of these guys.

I think the Celtics need to come around to the fact that they will have to get rid of one of Brown or Tatum eventually if they want to go to the next level. They seem to ebb and flow alternatively and since they are both more scorers than distributors, one of them will go off and the other will simply only take shots away from the hot player on offense (which is what happened when Brown got 46 and lost to the Knicks because Tatum still got his 30 shots up with a horrible FG%).

If Simmons comes in, he replaces Smart, whose two main skills (defense and passing), Simmons is much better at both. This allows Smart to slide to SG or lead the second unit, which he has done successfully in the past. Bringing Simmons in will mean that whatever remaining J can be the main guy and they will be fed by Simmons distribution.

Tbh I think Morey would say yes immediately, it'll just depend if Brad Stevens is willing to part with one of his guys."

122,[OC] Who is taking fewer free throws this year? Visualization of changes in FTA rate from 2021 to 2022,"On the [JJ Redick pod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S643YIIuEC0&ab_channel=JJRedick), JJ mentioned that the new rules hadn't been impacting guys like Jimmy Butler as much as others. I was curious to see whether that was the case, so I pulled some data from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_per_poss.html), and put together this plot:

https://imgur.com/a/MSwLEHg

I took the top 5% of players in total free throw attempts in 2021, and then looked at how their per-100 possession FTA **rates** changed from last year to this year. The arrows start at their 2021 value and end at their 2022 value. I did the same thing for per-game rates, and the patterns are quite similar.

 It's still early in the season, so the per-100 possession and per-game rates are still from smaller sample sizes and may change, but I think this is a good look at how much the rules are impacting certain players.

JJ was totally right, Jimmy is actually taking free throws at a *higher* rate than last year."

125,"In 378 minutes with Doncic on the floor, the Mavericks have a Net Rating of -12.4 points per 100 possessions. In 150 minutes without him, they're +19.0 points per 100 possessions.","Kind of a weird stat. Luka's on-off is terrible, easily worse than any other star player's.

With Luka (378 min), the Mavs score 101.9 and allow 114.3 points per 100 poss (-12.4 Net Rating)

Without him (150 min), they score 106.9 and allow 87.9 points per 100 poss (+19.0 Net Rating)

That's an **On-Off Net Rating of -31.4 points per 100** possessions, which is very weird for the best player of a 7-4 record team.

[Source](https://www.nba.com/stats/team/1610612742/onoffcourt-summary/?sort=DIFF_NET_RATING&dir=-1)

BTW Jalen Brunson's On-Off is impressive, +23.0 ON, -2.4 OFF, +25.4 NET.

Haven't watched the Mavericks much, are they that bad with their starters? Not that I'd be surprised because fuck Jason Kidd but they still have a 7-4 record which is weird, since Luka and most of their starters don't seem to be playing well.

Some context:

With Luka playing, the Mavs have a worse net rating than the Pelicans (worst net rating and worst record in the league, 1-11)

With Luka sitting, the Mavs have a better net rating than the Warriors (best net rating and best record in the league, 10-1)

Logic would stand that if you can hit it from 30 ft you can equally hit it from 15 ft right? Is it just simply down to preference rather than ability to make one over the other? Really interested to hear a response.

131,Can Wiggins play more consistently like he did yesterday?,Not 35 every game  but just being more aggressive and attacking the rim. He's just way more fun to watch when he actually uses his athleticism and dunks. This is the Wiggins everyone wanted to see as the #1 pick.

133,What if a player breaks a record in an All Star Game,"I was thinking about this for some time now, but I never really looked into it. Let's say for example someone breaks the three pointers made in a game record set by Klay in the ASG. How would that be handled? Would that actually count, or are those stats just sent to the void like those in the Bubble and Play-In(that's my theory)."
134,Are there any basketball players with physical disabilities that you’re excited about?,"I think it’s exciting when athletes with physical disabilities compete at the highest level against able-bodied athletes.

In basketball, the only example I can think of is Hansel Emmanuel. I’m not sure if there are any NBA prospects with physical disabilities yet tho.

I don’t follow other forms of basketball like wheelchair basketball, but if you know any exciting athletes in those sports, I’m also interested."

136,If KD wins the scoring title this season it will break one of Jordans records.,"Haven't seen this posted yet but will remove if I'm wrong.

Jordan won his first scoring title in 1986/87 and his last in 1997/98. 11 seasons later.


If KD can win it this year it would be 12 seasons after his first in 09/10."

138,Taking a look at some other metrics,"This is all with a minimum of 10 games played         

**Boxing Out**        
So far this season Montrezl Harrell and Bam Adebayo are averaging the most box outs per game at 3.6 each. Jonas Valanciunas is averaging the most offensive box outs a game at 1.6 and Montrezl Harrell is averaging the most defensive box outs a game at 3.0. The Knicks are averaging 3.2 rebounds a game off of Mitchell Robinson box outs leading the league. Valanciunas is averaging the most rebounds per game off of his own boxouts at 2.3.      

&nbsp;

**Hustle**        
Gary Trent Jr leads the league in deflections per game with 4.6 Paul George recovers the most loose balls on the offensive end with 1 a game. Ja Morant recovers the most loose balls on the defensive end with 1.3 a game and leads the league in total loose balls recovered a game with 2.1. Rudy Gobert leads the league in screen assists per game with 6.4 and points off of screen assist with 15.7 a game. Evan Mobley leads the league in shots contested per game with 15.5. Derrick White leads the league in charges drawn per game at 0.64.          

&nbsp;

**Shooting/Scoring**        
Carmelo Anthony leads the league in points per game off of catch and shoot with 9.2. LaMarcus Aldridge is shooting 68.8% on catch and shoot opportunities leading the league. Kevin Durant is leading the league in points off of pullup shots with 12.9. Tyler Herro and Og Anunoby are the best late in the shot clock scorers with 1.1 made FG in the last 4 seconds on the shotclock a game. Anthony Davis leads the league in attempting 10.8 FG a game with 0 dribbles. Buddy Hields leads the league in 3pm with defender with 0-2 feet with 0.6 a game on 67%.

150,"[Krawczynski] ""What really bothered Wiggins, according to players who have kept in touch with him since he joined GS, was the perceived hypocrisy of it all...“That man held my daughter” Wiggins said with disdain to anyone who asked him about both his trade and his reaction to the firing of Rosas.""","[Source](https://theathletic.com/2945867/2021/11/11/andrew-wiggins-dunks-all-over-the-wolves-to-render-a-final-verdict-on-a-seismic-trade/)

Full Quote:

> As Wiggins approached the rim, Towns started to rise with him, giving some thought to contesting the dunk attempt. But the force may have surprised him. Towns wanted to see that fire from Wiggins, especially after Jimmy Butler’s exit, one that implicated both Towns and Wiggins as too soft around the league. Wiggins shrugged it off like he did everything else. Nothing got to him. Nothing bothered him, except for how things ended in Minnesota.

> What really bothered Wiggins, according to players who have kept in touch with him since he joined Golden State, was the perceived hypocrisy of it all. One thing that Wiggins has always valued is family. It is everything to him. So when Rosas arrived and started to preach the importance of family to Wiggins, organized a trip to the Bahamas, met with Wiggins’ family, it resonated with him. At a Twins game during Rosas’ first summer on the job, he cradled Wiggins’ daughter in his arms and promised to build a relationship not just with Wiggins the player, but Wiggins the person.

> Rosas preached the importance of staying together, of bonding and fighting even when they were undermanned. So when Rosas traded him, Wiggins didn’t flip out, because he never flips out. But he did find it funny, all that talk about family and togetherness only to see Rosas trade all but two of the players that took that Bahamas trip before Rosas’ tenure was even a year old. Then came Rosas’ unceremonious exit just before training camp, and it did not go unnoticed.

> “That man held my daughter,” Wiggins said with disdain to anyone who asked him about both his trade and his reaction to the firing of Rosas."

Westbrook may be a triple double machine but he's also a turnover machine and isn't exactly efficient at shooting.

How did the Wizards steal 3 decent players from the Lakers alongside future picks? Yet guess what the Dodgers gave for Trea Turner and top tier pitcher Max Scherzer? A top-ish prospect and some mid-tier prospects.

I don't understand why NBA teams demand so much for superstars? Look at Ben Simmons? Isn't this a total joke that Morey wants 3 first rounders for a guy who can't shoot? Tell me how Trea Turner gets so less but Ben Simmons can't even get accepted for less than 3 first round picks?"

Plus/minus is not a perfect statistic by any means, and it is often used as an index of individual performance like counting stats. That's NOT what I intend to do here.

Dragic getting DNP'd has no trade value and will probably get bought out or salary dumped. They might as well have left Lowry left for nothing
171,Scottie Barnes or Evan Mobley? Who would you pick?,"It's clear that these two are the best rookies, so far. If you had to pick one to build around, who would you pick? 

I give the slight edge to Barnes because he has better handles and can playmake, but Mobley is so polished and he outplayed Scottie the last time they played. Also, a playmaking wing player like Barnes is more valuable in the modern NBA, so he gets the slight edge."

180,Twolves need to move KAT - for sake of Edwards & the franchise,"As a lifelong TWOLVES fan and MN local, I’ve had enough of KAT. Over the past two years I’ve really soured on him and his constant complaining. 

As the TWOLVES hit a fresh 6 game losing streak (which will most likely be 9 soon), it is another year as a bad team. Ironically though, we are not bad enough to get high draft picks (exception edwards and KAT). We’ll probably land in the 4-8 range. My personal motto for pro sports is you either need to be really good or really bad…mediocre kills your franchise and builds fan apathy.

It is time to turn the franchise to Edwards by trading KAT (and DLO) for assets and immediate help.

Potential targets (no particular order):
-KAT for Simmons + picks (I’m okay having simmons be point and just defend, run everything through Edwards)

-KAT for Ayton, Bridges and picks (ayton must have some heartburn about not getting the max extension)

-KAT for Cade Cunningham + Stewart + picks and filler (maybe grant) *doubt pistons would accept

-KAT for John Collins, Reddish, Huerter + picks

-KAT for Scottie Barnes and Siakam

TLDR: Wolves need to move KAT and turn franchise over to Edwards + trade ideas"

Kat and Booker have always wanted to play together (at least they used to) it would definitely hurt there defense a shit ton, but thay offense would be insane for the suns.

As for the wolves I know some people aren't that higj of Ayton but I personally think he was top 5 center potential (I mean I'd argue he is already on the outside looking in when it comes to the upper echelon of centers.) 

Wolves get a young higj value piece to pair a grow with Anthony Edward's and possibly some picks on top?

185,Context behind Westbrook's disastrous' on/off numbers,"Let me start that by saying it is NOT a ""Actually Westbrook has been great"" post, he's been bad, like at the start of the last 4 seasons, and him being bad at the start doesn't mean he'll magically be good in january, he's 33 now.

With that being said there's a pretty clear picture of what line ups he absolutely can't play with :

\- of the 10 most used line ups involving Russ, actually only 3 of them have been bad, which would be a good sign if...

\- 2 of those 3 weren't the 2 versions of the starting 5 that the Lakers have used (Russ - Baze - AD - DJ + either Bron or Bradley), those 2 line ups have the most mins, and have been a complete disaster, shouldn't be surprise, it's a line up with no shooting, and with a lot of ""hey he looks like a good defensive player, but actually he was good on defense 5 years ago""

\- every line up with Westbrook and Malik Monk, the Lakers only shooter who has played real minutes, are all in the positive

\- the line ups with Westbrook and only one big (Dwight or AD, the 2 bigs that actually deserves to play) have mostly been in the positive

&#x200B;

Vogel has quickly come to the conclusion that Westbrook shouldn't ever play with Rondo (duh), now it's seems pretty clear that the next step is that Westbrook shouldn't ever play with Jordan.

Jordan individual numbers feel fine, but he kills the spacing, and the Lakers don't really defend or rebound well wit him on the floor, so he's basically useless.

But that's what make the Lakers' current roster with both Ariza/Bron a abysmal fit : they just have to play AD at the 4 some because Melo is the only other forward on the roster (unless they play Sekou, and well....maybe he's not worst than DJ who knows), all the other players are guards or center.

Pretty sure Westbrook should always play with either Monk or Ellington, heck given how meh Bazemore has looked on both ends maybe even both : if the Lakers HAVE to start 2 bigs, they can't continue to start 2 meh shooters + Russ + 2 bigs."

Of course it's unrealistic for him to continue that mark (he probably won't shoot 11/12 every game), but really it demonstrates the continuing trend of how much he has refined his game, even after winning MVP in 2014.  In Seattle/OKC, KD shot 42% on such shots.  Post OKC, he is posting an extraordinary 52.7%.  For reference, BBallRef has shooting data on Michael Jordan's last 4 years in the league.  Discounting his time with the Wizards, he shot 49% during the 97 and 98 seasons. 

KD is also posting career highs in 2 point (64.5%) percentage despite the fact that he is shooting the lowest proportion of field goal attempts at the rim in his career (14%), and career highs in true shooting (67.4%) percentage despite posting career lows in free throw percentage (82.9%) on his 4th lowest number of attempts (6.3).  Effectively, all this means is that his jumper is at the best it has ever been, even after his Achilles tear and spotty attendance last year, and that he is relying on it more now than ever before, with mind boggling effect."

Edit 1 :

**Doncic/DFS/Powell/KP lineups currently score 91.9 per 100 possessions, bottom 2 percentile in the league.**  Luka needs to play waaay better, but I think 11 games in this offense looks bad. Kidd needs to figure out how to get him going, as much as others.

Edit 2:

Talked to

[@KirkSeriousFace](https://twitter.com/KirkSeriousFace)

on a pod yesterday, **how Slovenia was up there, NO 2 offense in the Olympics, almost the same rank as USA all-star team. Mavs were top 10 offense last 2yrs...  Being 21 in the league on offense just seems odd**

Edit 3:

**11 games in we still see KP post-up during the Luka Powell pick-and-rolls, and Powell shooting corner 3s.   They need to change fix that. Don't think there is easy solution to the starting 5, as KP cant play KP the 5 full-time. But maybe swap DFS with Bullock and fix the spacing**

One other thing I noted on

[@KirkSeriousFace](https://twitter.com/KirkSeriousFace)

pod last night.  **Dallas is bad at rim rolling atm. 20th in the league.  They were 5th last yr, 2nd in 19-20, 3rd in 18-19.**

207,Who among the NBA player who didnt sign the max extension to the team that drafted them?,"Example is when a rookie get drafted by a team. And that player turn out to be a generational talent. But when the rookie contract expired that player decided to sign with another team. 

Is that possible? Is there a rule that you need to sign max extension whether you like it or not. If so , who among the NBA did that?"
208,Who thinks Zion will end up signing for the max with the Pelicans then request a trade?,Basically what a lot of other star players have done. Seems plausible that Zion will do the same. It'd be sorta unprecedented though if he does it after just one or two seasons though.
209,Any other neutrals starting to get excited by OKC's young core?,"Giddey, SGA, Dort, Poku... They may be unpolished - and I know this is OKC we're talking about - but I honestly think you could build a championship team around that core if they keep improving."
210,How hard would it be for a player to win all individual regular season awards?,"I've been wondering about this for quite some time, and it would not only take a lot of talent (obviously) but also a bit of luck, since winning the ROY and the MIP for example means that this player has to have a good but not great rookie season and still win the award, but still have enough room to improve and win the MIP later in his career...
What do you think? Who was - or could be - the closest to win them all (ROY, MIP, 6MOTY, DPOY and MVP)?
Sorry if there are mistakes in my text, English isn't my first language!"
211,What age do big men usually enter their primes,"Referring to players like KAT, Embiid, AD, Jokic, Gobert etc. Towns especially. If I had to guess mid 20s is about when they enter?

Giannis won his first MVP at 24

Gobert won his first DPOY at 25

Jokic won his MVP at 25

AD won his Championship at 26

Towns should closely be entering his if he's not already in it. What're the Wolves plan with KAT entering his prime? Are they still rebuilding / tanking around him or has the plans changed with ANT on the rise. Will he be the focus now?"
212,Wiggins is so talented,"I made a similar post about a year ago about how frustrating Wiggins is to watch, especially as a Warriors fan. After watching tonight's game, I'm 100% convinced this guy could easily average 25 if he really wanted to. If he could take that energy he played with tonight, and kept it at that level for every game he played, he'd be an all star. He was aggressive, not settling for those contested mid range jumpers, and was literally dunking everything. Man is 6'8"" with a decent jumper, a 40+ inch vert, and plays very solid defense. He has all he needs to be that type of player but most of the time it seems like he just doesn't want to. Flashes like tonight are so fun to watch yet so frustrating at the same time. He can do this all the time but just doesn't. Still love him tho, great to have him on our team."
213,Kuzma autographs “Lebron got Kuzma his ring” sign and tells fan “it’s your fault”,
214,Looney recorded 12 offensive rebounds,"It may have been overshadowed by Edwards’ and Wiggins’ stat line (and huge dunks), but Kevon Looney had more offensive rebounds than half the teams that played tonight. The last time someone had more was Gobert in the 2016/17 season (Capela had 12 last season and on average, 1-2 of these games happens per season).

Lol at AD's awareness about the narratives regarding Russ' stats. 

Lakers finally developing a little bit of chemistry. Still a lot to clean up both offensively and defensively, but while they have a lot of injuries, it's a good thing it's still less than 15 games in the season.

218,"When a player grabs 20 or more rebounds in a game, what do you call it?","One of the guys from the *No Dunks* podcasts, a NBA podcast that I would recommend to basketball fans, came up with a term for when a guy grabs 20 or more rebounds in a single game: “a roast beef”.

For example, Andre Drummond has grabbed 20+ rebounds in back-to-back games this week, so one could say ""Drummond has had a couple of roast beefs this week.""  It's silly term but its a funny & effective way to name a somewhat common feat a la ""triple-doubles"".

A fan of the *No Dunks* podcast even created a website that tracks ""roast beefs"" called [https://bigbeeftracker.com/](https://bigbeeftracker.com/) and a twitter account called @BigBeefTracker.

Since the 1982-83 NBA season, Dennis Rodman, Andre Drummond, Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, Charles Barkley & Dikembe Mutombo are the only players with 50 or more games with 20+ rebounds.

Dennis Rodman has the most such games with 158 games while Drummond is 2nd with 86.

Last season, Gobert & Capela led the league in 20+ rebound games with 6 each.

Next time you see a player grab 20+ boards in a game, would you called it a ""roast beef""?"

What does this actually mean, what does AD playing center do? What are they able to do differently?"

246,Steph Curry ties Ray Allen for most threes all time (REG SEASON + PLAYOFFS),">Steph Curry has tied Ray Allen for the most threes in NBA history including playoffs.

>Steph has played in 586 fewer games. 

He's also nearing the regular season record, set to be broken within the next few weeks or so

https://twitter.com/statmuse/status/1458668360820875269?t=1wzjljLCYlVC7L4Gao5NbQ&s=19"
247,Wiggins Revenge Game 35/4/0,Absolute dominant performance from Andrew Wiggins posting 35 on 14/19 and 3/6  from beyond while going 4/4 from the charity stripe. Tacked along 2 steals and 4 boards. Helped secure momentum with a huge 3 and huge posters on KAT. Great game.
248,Is boban the next shaq?,I feel like boban will be the NBA’s next big man poster boy. first the goldfish commercial then i just saw him in a chime ad. Maybe it’s just the weed but I hope he has a successfull commercial career. GO CLIPPERS
249,[Highlight] Andrew Wiggins dunks over KAT late in the 4th quarter,
250,Bulls vs Warriors on ESPN Friday,"I’m biased (as a Bulls fan), but this feels like an early game of the year candidate with the way these two teams are playing and all the highlights they generate. Can’t wait to see it and I hope it’s as good as it can be (with a Bulls win)"
251,[Highlight] Wiggins drains the three over KAT to extend the lead to 13!,
252,[Highlight] Anthony Edwards hits a three for his new career high - 43 pts!,
253,"2017 redraft (Tatum, Mitchell, Bam, Fox, etc)","4 years in, how would you redraft 2017? As a starting point, here are Nate Silver's current 5 year projections:

1. Tatum: $218m
2. Lonzo: $143m
3. Mitchell: $136m
4. Fox: $116m
5. John Collins: $106m
6. Derrick White: $105m
7. Bam: $101m
8. Anunoby: $99m
9. Jarrett Allen: $66m
10. Jonathan Isaac: $66m
11. Josh Hart: $56m

254,Dwight Howard fouls out in 11 minutes...,"Dwight Howard exits the game after fouling out in 11 minutes played. He also had 0 shot attempts, 3 rebounds and 2 turnovers. Has to be close to some kind of record?"
255,Players not in uniform walking up and down the bench. Is that allowed?,Just seeing LeBron walk up and down the side of the court talking with ref's and players and stepping onto the court during stoppages seems like that's not how things work? Is there a rule preventing players not in uniform from walking up and down the sideline like LeBron is?
256,"Is It Me, or Do Some Owners Just Don't Care About Winning Anymore?","The NBA's TV contracts are getting to near NFL levels, and in reality, the NBA is much more popular than the NFL on a world wide scale.

&#x200B;

The main source for revenue for many NBA owners is now TV deals and not attendance. It is pretty clear some owners have no desire to even try to put together winning teams and are just comfortable sitting back and collecting TV revenue as their franchises grow in value, for the sole reason that they are in the NBA.

&#x200B;

There is just a clear division between teams who want to win and teams who are happy being mediocre (or even terrible) and collecting all that money"
257,[highlight] Naz Reid with the slam,
258,[Highlight] Pacers vs Nuggets Full Game Highlights,
259,The Blazers and Rockets are the only remaining teams that have yet to win a road game.,"Rockets are tanking so it's expected.

The Blazers played against good teams though. Understandable why they haven't won a road game yet.

@Clippers - No Kawhi.

@Hornets

@Sixers - This was a bad loss. Embiid, Harris, Simmons and I think a few other Sixers role players were out.

@Cavs - I don't think this was a bad loss. The Cavs have been playing well this season.

@Clippers - No Kawhi

@Suns - Frank Kaminsky dropped 31 points on them on 12-18 shooting.

Still, for a team as good as the Blazers, you'd think they'd win 1 out 6."

262,De'Aaron Fox vs. Spurs: 37 PTS 2 REB 6 AST | 14-24 FG 2-5 3FG 7-8 FT but an L,"37 Points

2 Rebounds

6 Assists

14-24 FG

2-5 from Three

7-8 from the line

But an L

Hopefully this game would be a great momentum booster for Fox, as Fox is having a rough start for this year. Hopefully the Kangz would actually be good now, hopefully his teammates will step up as well

Yes a lot of ""hopefully""

\-from a Hawks Fan"
263,Where would prime John Stockton rank in today’s league?,"Put him on the Lakers with Lebron and AD, or even have him replace Conley on his original team. It doesn’t matter what team  you put him on, where does he rank?"
264,Why have the Pelicans flopped this season so far?,They got Zion and a ton of trading assets to work with but so far this season the results seem lackluster. What went wrong? How is Zion doing so far this season?
265,Steph Curry tripled his free throw misses this season in the first half tonight,"Steph went into tonight's game 50-51, and in this first half went 3-5, tripling his misses from 1 to 3 https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/3975/stephen-curry"
266,[Highlight] Trailblazers vs Suns Full Game Highlights,
267,"After a rocky shooting start to his career, Lonzo Ball is now shooting 45% from 3 and 83% from the free throw line this season","Obviously it's early in the season. But if you look at the year by year progress, it's a thing of beauty, for both 3PT shooting and FT shooting:

**3pt%**:

- 2018: 31%
- 2019: 33%
- 2020: 37%
- 2021: 38%
- 2022: 45%

**FT%**:

- 2018: 45%
- 2019: 42%
- 2020: 57%
- 2021: 78%
- 2022: 83%

Very encouraging to see this, especially for a guy who couldn't crack 50% from the FT line for the first few years of his career."

297,"[Fischer] After Ugly Exchange with Ex-Coach, Pels Exec David Griffin's Job Is on the Brink","Summary: 

- The Pelicans are 1-11.

- Pelicans GM & POBO David Griffin had heated exchange with former Pelicans HC and current Kings associate HC Alvin Gentry after Pelicans loss against the Kings. 

- Alvin Gentry was the Pelicans HC from 2015-2020, and was fired after the 2020 Bubble. 

- David Griffin became the Pelicans' POBO in April 2019 (before the Zion lottery). This was Griffin's first job in an NBA organization after the Cavaliers didn't renew his contract in 2017.

- Rumblings regarding David Griffin's future in New Orleans are increasing now, especially after this altercation.

Article:

>The rumblings began following the Pelicans' 0-3 start (currently a league-worst 1-11 after Wednesday’s loss to OKC), coupled with Griffin's public handling of All-Star forward Zion Williamson's prolonged recovery from offseason foot surgery. New Orleans brass certainly hoped Griffin's tenure would finally lead to a playoff berth, despite its tenuous two years building around Williamson.

>Word of a heated exchange between Griffin and Sacramento Kings associate head coach Alvin Gentry has since circled around the league.

>Griffin and Gentry first connected during a shared tenure in Phoenix in the Steve Nash era. And later the Pelicans head coach from 2015 to 2020, Gentry played an integral role in helping Griffin land New Orleans' head of basketball operations position in 2019, only for the executive to fire Gentry following just one season. 

>While New Orleans projected optimism about competing for a postseason berth during the Orlando bubble, Gentry and a large portion of Pelicans staffers were already prepared for the coach's ouster, sources said, as Griffin was widely known to covet Ty Lue, who was the head coach in Cleveland when Griffin served as the general manager for LeBron James' 2016 championship team. Griffin would often tell team and other league officials that he'd given Gentry ""all the answers to the test, and he still fails,"" sources confirmed to B/R.

>After the Kings defeated the Pelicans 113-109 on Oct. 29, Griffin approached Gentry in the bowels of Smoothie King Center to offer a warm hello to his former head coach, yet Gentry brushed off his initial efforts as inauthentic.

>From there, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the incident, Griffin denied the findings of the NOLA.com article, particularly his ""answers to the test"" line, and the notion that he played piano for Williamson during the team's bubble stay in Disney World. 

>Gentry responded with his own choice words, noting how his eventual replacement, Stan Van Gundy, who was also fired after one season in New Orleans, finished just one game better (31-41) than the Pelicans did under Gentry (30-42) the year he was let go. ""You must not have given Stan the answers to the test, either,"" Gentry shouted at Griffin, according to multiple sources, and the two men had to be physically separated.

>Griffin did not continue on the Pelicans' road trip, sources said, and was notably absent from the team's game against Golden State on Friday, which New Orleans lost 126-85.

>The aftermath of that event has seemed to ripple around the league, leading to increased whispers about the future of New Orleans without Griffin at the helm of the Pelicans basketball operations. League observers have noted New Orleans' repeated appearances in national television games, that were supposed to feature Williamson, have cast a far larger spotlight on the Pelicans' losing dynamic than otherwise would have existed.

316,Every Charlotte starter had 5+ assists in tonight's win over Memphis,"Hayward with 5, Bridges with 6, Plumlee with 5, Rozier with 5, and Ball with 8. Quite a passing display by the Hornets, assisting on 32/41 field goals."
317,Cade Cunningham tonight: 20 points 4 rebounds 3 assists on 8/18 shooting,"Great bounceback game from him and who to do it better against than Jalen Green. He had good defensive stats as well and helped ice the game with a clutch layup. The future is bright in Detroit as Cade should shortly cement himself in the ROTY race

318,"Lonzo: 21/6/6/ with 7/10 from three. Caruso: 16/1/2 with 6 steals. 3/4 from three, 6/7 from the Field. Absolutely a 4th Quarter Monster.","Caruso with 6 steals, this man and Lonzo made our Perimeter defense SCARY. Im so glad we got both of these guys. Lonzo 7/10 from three absolutely COOKING"
319,[Serious] Is it fair to say that Luka Doncic is not a top 10 NBA player this season?,"His 3 point percentage is atrocious and he's shooting below average. Instead of a Harden, he's more in the Jimmy Butler tier of good player but not an elite one this season."
320,All five Bucks starters vs the Knicks shot better from 3 than from 2,"Giannis - 2/5 from 3 (40%) / 3/10 from 2 (30%) 

Hill - 2/3 from 3 (66.67%) / 1/4 from 2 (25%) 

Holiday - 4/6 from 3 (66.67%) / 3/10 from 2 (30%) 

Allen - 5/11 from 3 (45.54%) / 0/2 from 2 (0%) 

Portis - 3/5 from 3 (60%) / 3/6 from 2 (50%)  

Must be so annoying to successfully wall off Giannis at the rim just to have everyone make one million threes."
321,Kelly Oubre Jr. sets the Hornets all-time record for points off the bench with 37 points tonight against the Grizzlies.,"This record was previously held by Malik Monk, who had 36 off the bench last season against the Miami Heat.

331,Dumb question about defending the three,I feel like the school of thought previously to the modern age was stop the driver and make them kick so collapse on the person who is driving to the paint. But that was when there wasn't that many good three point shooters. So now with the prolific shooting in the NBA should you stay home on shooters and not help when someone deifies the ball?
332,[CLIP REQUEST] Rozier to Bridges emphatic alley-oop vs Grizzlies,"Happened during the 2nd half of today’s game. Fast break, pass too high but Miles was able to catch it and throw it down with his left hand. Crazy sequence!"

336,"Scottie Barnes Against the Celtics Tonight: 21 Points, 4 Assists, 7 Rebounds","On:

7/11 FG

7/8 FT

The loss was tough overall and Scottie still isn't taking many 3-point shots (he didn't take a single one this game) but he's been attacking the rim well and taking more shots like Nick Nurse wants him to.  For a season I expected to be developmental for Barnes and Achiuwa, Scottie is much farther along offensively than I expected him to be by Game 12."
337,"James Harden - 17 Points, 11 Rebounds, 11 Assists, 2 Steals, 6/11 FG in 3 Quarters.",
338,"[Trudell] LAL have only 10 players available tonight, including 2-way player Sekou Doumbouya. Starters: Westbrook, Bradley, Bazemore, AD and Jordan. Subs: Carmelo, Ellington, Monk, Doumbouya and Howard. LAL are especially short at PG. When Russ isn’t on the floor, it’ll be by committee.",
339,[Highlight] LaMelo gets a dunk!,
340,"[Highlight] Giannis with the block on Toppin. Originally ruled a foul, Bucks challenge and it's overturned.",
341,Thoughts on this years rookie class draftees performances,"Now i am overwhelmed. It’s so much fun watching these young kids hoop!
Ill go in order tho.

CADE: Wow. He’s special. Media tried to make him pressure by “underperforming” while probably rushing back from an injury. And probably needed some time to adjust to Detroit and the NBA. 82 games a season is something else man. I’m not worried at all. He will be a generational player! 

JALEN GREEN: He will just keep scoring the Basketball for the next 15 years. If its gonna be Harden type volume or Jamal Crawford/Lou Will type. Well see. seems like he’s enjoying his situation in Houston. Hope that stays that way. 

MOBLEY: Phenomenal. I mean the stuff he’s been doing is truly special and i have to say i did not expect him to do this well this early and wasn’t the biggest fan of him. My mind has changed. Gives me Tim Duncan/Kevin Garnett vibes. And i have to get credit to the Cavs coaching staff. Love seeing this three 7-footer line-up. Mobley has been impressive (15/8/2.5/1/1.3)

SCOTTIE BARNES: Turns out he was worth all the hype. No the Raps did not flop by selecting him over Suggs. Blowing away expectations offensively. 16.6ppg (1st among rookies) while delivering as expected on the defensive side. Playmaking has also looked promising.

JALEN SUGGS: Hell be fine. Too much talent and work ethic to be a bust. 

GIDDEY/JRE/TRE MANN: Congrats on the Thunder scouting staff of finding a raw diamond. Yet again. Flat out impressive stuff as well. JRE has been outperforming his expectations over and over again and he’s already playing like a 10 year old vet. Not much more to get out of him butt hell become excellent at what he’s doing and thats so important! Tre Mann has gotten to his spots in every game he has played (summer league, NBA, G-league) but shots have not been falling. If he remains confident i see him succeed.

FRANZ WAGNER: Just like JRE Franz is playing like a veteran. Defending, scoring, sharing the ball. Shot has looked good. ATHLETICISM has been there. Hell keep getting better. 

MOODY/KUMINGA: One of em could pop. Raw tho. Still unsure due to minimal playing time. 

DUARTE: Yeah. Haven’t sent anything else aside from his highlights but seems like the real deal.

AYO: Haven’t watched anything of him yet. 

PS: I like that Trey Murphy III kid from the Pelicans

Thunder fan from Germany btw."

350,"[Highlight] Kevin Durant with the fadeaway mid range over 7'1"" Mo Bamba like he ain't even there",
351,"Take me back to ""The Decision"" what was fan response like? what did you think of it at the time?",I didn't follow basketball at the time (I barely follow it now to be fair) but I know its an infamous part of LeBron's history. Did people know what was going on days before and him dragging it out what made it bad? or how he made the announcement? How did the media react? how did reddit react if it was around back then?
352,[Highlight] Kevin Porter Jr. with the blowby and the jam!,
353,Cavs team looks very exciting,"I’ve been paying close attention to the Cavs this year. At first I was wondering how Mobley would play next to Allen but it looks fantastic so far. 

I love how the team was constructed with Rubio, Garland, Allen, Mobley, Osman, and Okoro. 

Even though it’s always a shame when a player goes down injured, I believe that the Cavs will be better without Sexton. Sexton isn’t an efficient scorer and not much of a playmaker, making him not a very good point guard. This gives Garland more time to shine. 

I’m predicting a top 6 finish."
354,Kevin Durant first Nets player in 40 years to be this efficient on offense in a game,"Kevin Durant took 12 shots tonight. He finished with 30 points.

He’s the first Nets player to score 30+ on 90% shooting in the last 40 seasons.

KD leads the NBA with 29.5 PPG on 58.5 FG% this season.

360,[Slater] Here’s a Steve Kerr update on James Wiseman. Sounds like some live scrimmage action with Santa Cruz could come next week while Warriors are on the road. Klay Thompson may also get in on it.,
361,[CLIP REQUEST] Rob Williams half court alley oop from Marcus Smart,Celtics vs Raptors. Happened somewhere towards the end of Q2. Would love if someone could upload it. Cheers!
362,[Highlight] DeRozan COOKS the Mavericks defense for the smooth layup at the rim,
363,"[Highlight] Giannis tries to bait the foul off the pump fake, doesn't get the call and looks perplexed!",
364,"[Highlight] Allen hammers it on Gafford, Garland gets the steal and Stevens yams it on Gafford!",
365,Is Corey Brewer a hall of Famer?,"I’m watching the Celtics game and the question pops into my head is Al Horford a hall of famer? Off his NBA accolades probably not but then I remembered his two titles at Florida and I figured he’s got to be. And if he’s a hall of famer, Joakim Noah has to be right? So I guess my question is what is the baseline for members of that Florida team to get in? Is Brewers NBA tittle and final four outstanding player enough in addition to those 2 NCAA titles."
366,[ESPN] The man who helped develop Kobe and LeBron is guiding the Rockets' next generation,
367,When is a trade that both teams would hate a fair trade or a lose-lose situation?,"I'm just wondering, like how compromises are said to be fair if both teams have qualms, does that also work in NBA trades, or are there lose-lose situations?  

For example, a friend of mine always says that Timberwolves and Sixers should do a trade. Simmons and Seth Curry for Patrick Beverley and Dlo Russell. I say no, because Sixers would lose their biggest asset for improvement right now (Simmons) and a real underpaid shooter (Curry). Timberwolves could strain KAT's relationship by trading his best friend that he tried his best to get just two years ago, so it's a lose lose situation.  
  
His thoughts are as follows though. KAT and Simmons complement each other well. Embiid finally gets a point guard that can shoot and make plays, and the Embiid and PatBev is a defensive duo that can pester/troll any team in the league. PatBev may be 33, but Seth is also 31. Sixers would be replacing an all-defense player with no offense to a capable scorer/playmaker with no defense, and a 31 year old great shooter with no defense to a 33 year old with great shooting and good defense.  

So in that case is it a lose-lose situation or a fair (compromise) trade? Since both team's fans would certainly be against the trade.

edit: Yup, I'm a nephew. the trade I said was not fair at all. What about trading Simmons for Kyrie straight up? Surely a Sixer fan is willing to try to inject Kyrie with a vaccine hahaha"
368,What do in depth knowledgeable fans pay attention to in games other than the obvious ball watching & score?,"Im a newish fan to the NBA (I'm Australian), but I watch heaps of other sports, in all of which I find that you both watch what's happening as well as what's 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 happening I.e. strategy and positioning, games within games, and 'the long game'.

I.e. in soccer you also pay lots of attention to the defensive structures up and back on the field, think about how substitute players could affect the game, set plays for free kicks & corners

In F1 there's a lot of understanding tire wear and pit stop strategies, and understanding who's in the lead now doesn't necessarily have the best position for winning the race

In Aussie Rules football there's a lot of forwards trying to wear out the defensive player that's on them to score more in the last quarter, plus if a team ever gets too far behind late in the game they flip the switch and change to a high risk right reward game style.

What do I need to learn to 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 watch in basketball to get more enjoyment out of it? Are there any YouTube videos or anything that can explain this stuff really well?"

385,Who has the saltiest commentators in the league?,"I just watched the Atlanta Hawks broadcast when Steph scored 50, and these guys are actually so fucking salty it's comical. 

An even better experience was when James Harden destroyed the Hawks a couple seasons ago, when he was on the Rockets. 

The Rockets were up big but Harden was going to get his 60 piece. 

It was actually one of the funniest games I have ever watched.

Guys are saying he’s a top 10 all time player and better than guys like Kobe, Magic, Bird and I just don’t get where this take came from. Can someone explain what makes KG so appealing to fans recently?"

390,Derrick Rose is second in the NBA in total RAPTOR.,"New York fans won’t hesitate to tell you how good he’s been this year. The bench unit is a positive in nearly every game they play, largely thanks to Derrick Rose and his surprisingly improved defense this season.

Only Jokic has a higher total RAPTOR than D Rose. 

https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/

Shout out D Rose."
391,Who is the NBA version of Odell Beckham Jr?,"The Cleveland Browns just released the former star Wide Receiver Odell Beckham Jr. He was awesome for the Giants, he’s shown HoF potential, but injuries stopped him.

396,"[Feigen] The Rockets’ plans for a ""Travis Scоtt Day"" on Wednesday were canceled, replaced with a moment of silence before the game against the Detroit Pistons in the wake of the Astrоworld Festival tragedy last week.","[Source](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/texas-sports-nation/rockets/article/Rockets-cancel-Travis-Scott-Day-moment-of-silence-16610726.php?)

> The Rockets’ plans for a ""Travis Scоtt Day"" on Wednesday were canceled, replaced with a moment of silence before the game against the Detroit Pistons in the wake of the Astrоworld Festival tragedy last week.
> 
> The Rockets had planned a themed T-shirt giveaway at Wednesday’s game. After the tragedy, in which at least eight people diеd and many others were injured in the crush near the stage, those plans were dropped and the Rockets' social media posts were deleted. The Rockets had not made an announcement about the change of plans under the circumstances.
> 
> “After what was a horrific tragedy last week, we felt it would have been insensitive and not the right time for us to move forward,” Rockets president of business operations Gretchen Sheirr said. “Tonight, we’ll honor victims with a moment of silence to help our community heal.”"

399,Monte Morris recounts a time when Nikola Jokic was gaming on his phone at halftime,
400,"[OPINION] ESPN's new ""NBA Today"" show is overblown and boring.","Not saying The Jump was any better.  However, I really cant even get through an episode without losing interest.  Anyone else tried watching?"
401,Which players and teams are quietly having a great start to the season?,"Teams like the Warriors, Heat, and Bulls have gotten a ton of love, and their stars have gotten a lot of credit for their good starts. But which teams and players have been quietly great?

For teams, the **Jazz** are looking like a regular season powerhouse, and might top the Western standings for the second straight season. The **Clippers** and **Suns** have also picked it up after a slow start. The **Wizards** and **Cavs** have impressed, but it seems like they've gotten attention more because people are predicting them to fall out of the playoffs and not because people think they improved in the offseason. 

For players, **Jokic** still isn't getting enough love. He isn't the MVP leader because Curry's Warriors are 9-1, but in my opinion he's been by far the best player from an individual standpoint. He looks unstoppable putting up 25.5 points on 69 TS% and is once again breaking every advanced catch all stat. **Will Barton** has also stepped up while MPJ is badly slumping. 

**Harrison Barnes** has been excellent as well, and is stepping up while Fox is slumping.

**Norman Powell** has lowkey been the Blazers' best player so far. He provides great scoring and solid defense and probably needs more touches."
402,NBA 75th Anniversary Template,Has anyone made or seen a template of the individual players for the 75th Anniversary team? like without the player or text in it?
403,"This week 2021 no.1 pick Cade Cunningham & Pistons will be playing Houston, Cleveland, & Toronto, meaning he will be playing the 2021 no.2, no.3, & no.4 picks in that order.","Tonight the Pistons will be taking on the  Rockets & no.2 pick Jalen Green in Houston

Friday they travel to Cleveland to play Evan Mobley & the Cavs 

And Saturday they come to Toronto to face off against Scottie Barnes & the Raptors 

Great week for anyone who wants to see some high lottery pick rookie head-to-head match ups

...And maybe greater week for people with rookie hot takes they can't wait to share

Edit: Pretty cool of the NBA to do that"
404,Is Steph better right now than he was in his 2016 season?,"Steph was out of this world in 2016, but has he regressed at all since then? While he obliterated the 3PM for a season record that year, the team around him was also much better than it is right now. I don't think he'll make the same number of 3's as he did that season, but that alone doesn't necessarily mean he's worse than he was in 2016.  Can someone point out somewhere that he has regressed since 2016? Anything I think about feels pretty much the same, if not better."
405,"Who's impacted by removing ""trick plays""? Raw data on FTA diff from 21/22 vs. 20/21","After seeing Dame as the latest player to complain about the refs/rule changes (indirectly) this season, I was curious to see how much it was impacting him - especially since he really steered into ""I don't do the trick plays.""

I knew he was struggling so far this season, to put it lightly, but I was surprised to see he's shooting 4 less FTA per game compared to last season. I wondered if anyone else had a greater differential (spoiler: nope), and how this was affecting other players.

I turned to our friends at basketball-reference, pulled their data into Excel, did some lookups, and the results are below. Obviously this is very young data right now with a small sample size for this season, but I thought it was interesting nonetheless. Trying to leave my opinion out of it as much as possible - just giving you the raw data to draw your own conclusions.

**Top 10 by Negative FTA Differential (2021/22 - 2020/21)**

441,LeBron deserved the 2011 MVP over D-Rose. Is this a controversial opinion?,"I posted this in another thread, assuming this was widely agreed with. It appears I was wrong and this is actually unpopular.

The argument goes like this: LeBron, newly of the Miami Heat, put up an MVP caliber season and deserved to win. But, because of lingering resentment from The Decision, voters gave the MVP to Derrick Rose instead.

Here are the stats:

Rose: 25 points, 4.1 rebounds, 7.7 assists, 1.0 steals, .6 blocks, 44.5% shooting, 33.2% from three. 81 Games Played. 

LeBron: 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.0 assists, 1.6 steals, .6 blocks, 51% shooting, 33.0% from three. 79 Games Played. 

The context:

Rose: The Bulls, in just Rose’s second year, took the one seed with a 62-20 record. His second best teammate was probably Luol Deng.

LeBron: The Heat finished with a 58-24 record, underachieving when you consider LeBron’s second best teammate was Dwyane Wade, with Chris Bosh right behind him. 

The argument for LeBron:

In addition to putting up better stats across the board, LeBron had to learn a new system, run by a new coach, and how to play with ball dominant stars. In addition to beating Rose in nearly every offensive statistic, he also was voted 9th in DPoY, with Rose receiving zero votes — indicating his defense was perceived at the time to be superior.

If LeBron was able to put up better offensive numbers than Rose, and played defense at a better level, why would Rose win? Presumably because he was the best player on the 1 seed, right?

But Chicago’s success came largely from its defense. They were 20th in PPG and 2nd in points allowed per game. This was indicated by the media voting for three Bulls players on the DPoY ballot (none of them Rose).

Why He Didn’t Win:

The MVP is a narrative award, and Rose (from Chicago originally) led his hometown team to the 1 seed just months after LeBron had a pep rally announcing to the world he would win “not five, not six, not seven” championships in Miami. Every opposing stadium HATED the Heat, and most NBA media were attacking him daily. This, coupled with a perception that Miami wasn’t as good as they should have been, hurt his case. The media was looking for a way to reward someone who wasn’t LeBron and Rose was good enough to be that person.

LeBron didn’t just lose, he finished in third behind Rose and Dwight Howard."

444,"The Utah Jazz are 1st in Offensive Rating per Cleaning the Glass, despite being 25th in 3 point percentage.","Cleaning the Glass eliminates garbage time from their numbers to show a more accurate representation of where teams are actually at in their performance. Thus far, the Jazz have really struggled from deep, most notably Jordan Clarkson who is shooting an alarming 23.8% from deep on 9.2 attempts per game. Donovan Mitchell and Bojan Bogdanovic have also struggled from three, at 31.5% and 31.7% respectively. 

The Jazz were one of the top three point shooting teams last season, so it's extremely surprising they haven't fallen apart with this poor shooting start. The Jazz also rank in the bottom third of the league in turnover percentage, which is not unusual for a Quin Snyder coached team. So how have they overcome this?

The biggest factor has been shot quality, where the Jazz have attempted by far the most amount of threes per game at 43. When I say shot quality, by the eye test, a lot of these threes don't look like quality shots even though the math says they are. They take a lot of early clock pullup threes that have you scratching your head wondering why they didn't get into their sets. But when you remember that they turn the ball over a lot, it makes sense to stay out of those sets if they can get an open look without passing the ball too much. Additionally, Rudy Gobert is obviously a force rolling to the rim, as well as Hassan Whiteside for a backup center, so the Jazz are getting a lot of efficient dunks and layups as usual.

The other big factor is offensive rebounding percentage, where the Jazz rank 2nd. Obviously Rudy Gobert has a lot to do with this, considering his height and length. But also, players like Donovan Mitchell, Eric Paschall, and Royce O'Neale have been extremely ""on it"" with their focus on crashing the boards from the corners and stealing rebounds that guards on other teams just don't get that often.

The Jazz still rank well behind the Golden State Warriors in Net Rating per Cleaning the Glass, but this could change if their three point shooting improves during an extended home stand."

> I ask Garnett if he feels contrite about his record as a transgressive trash talker, from allegedly calling former Pistons forward Charlie Villanueva “a cancеr patient” to berating Celtics teammate Glen Davis until he cried on the bench. Garnett mentions Joakim Noah, and how getting into the younger big man’s head yielded a competitive advantage the first time they squared off. “If I’d have known he was a huge fan like that, I probably wouldn’t have went so hard, but I’m in competition,” he says. “I’m a dragon. I’m out here [breathes fire].”

456,"Pelican fans, looking back at it would you guys have still wanted the team to draft Zion Williamson?","This is not a hate post by any means I'm just trying to start a discussion and for the record, I do believe Zion when healthy is going to be a top 10 player in the league in the near future. As a Sixer's fan, I have seen these types of posts throughout the year and especially early in Embiids career when it was hard for him to see the court so I know what the Pelicans fans must be going through. In my opinion there are only 2 players from Zions draft class which I could see a potential redraft for and they are Ja Morant and RJ Barret. I have been high on RJ Barret since he entered the league (which has netted me tons of downvotes on this subreddit) and he is continuing to develop every single year. RJ becomes a very balanced player with a mix of good shooting, BBIQ, and defense. Ja Morant I feel has already proven he can be a franchise player by leading the young team to a playoff birth very early on into his career. While both RJ and Morant both have upsides only Zion has elevated his play to become an All-Star. Zion is the better player out of the two but the question in a redraft comes when considering his health and durability."

The following players all led their respective teams – Royce O’Neale, Reggie Jackson.","Note: This daily review captures and records the top individual +/- figures from each game from the previous day. Plus/minus is not a perfect statistic by any means, and it is often used as an index of individual performance like counting stats. That's NOT what I intend to do here. I think single game +/- figures can reflect interesting things that are not immediately obvious about games from the headlines. Which players made a two-way impact? Which players are part of particularly useful rotations? When did teams win games?

462,Which player in the league do you think most needs to be “freed”?,"throughout the league there are some similar situations where a player has tons of potential or at least some potential but can’t seem to squeeze themselves into the rotation although all of the fans want to see them play and truly believe in at least giving them a shot . . . we want to see their mins increase and see if they deserve a more prominent role or perhaps they could simply benefit from a change of scenery and be a better fit on a different squad . . . 

a few players come to mind when considering this “freed” concept for me . . . 

**Obi Toppin**

- I’m a Knicks fan and Obi has shown great improvements in all aspects of his game (except maybe the 3 ball although he putting in work) and is always a spark plug off the bench and also is a better mobile big match up at times over Mitchell but hes only averaging 14 mins and theres times where he is bringing tons of heat and helping the Knicks back in the game or whatever or made a few clutch plays / shots but then coach Thibs just puts him back to the bench ….its very infuriating to me as a fan bc Obi always got energy and a nice swag on the floor and is often a huge help . . . FREE OBI!!!

**Goga Bitadze**

- idk been keeping my eye on this dude the past few seasons and he def learning a thing or 2 with Turner / Sabonis as mentors but Goga has his own skills to bring to the table as well, this dude is a stretch big who can drain 3s and idk i think he hustles and can be a defensive presence . . . FREE GOGA!!!

a few more players come to mind but anyways 

which player in the league do you feel most needs to be “freed”?"

465,Inside The NBA reacts to allegations against Suns Owner Robert Sarver,
466,The New Orleans Pelicans are basically a talent farm for other teams,"Think about it farms are where you grow crops and livestock and sell them off and thats what the Pelicans have done

* Chris Paul came in as a rookie and got sold off to lead the Clippers into the playoffs multiple teams
* AD came in as a rookie and got sold off to the Lakers for a ring
* After a lackluster career in Los Angeles Julius Randle came in and then used them for shot attempts to secure a bag in free agency 
* Christian Wood joined the team before leaving to secure the bag with Houston
* Jrue Holiday rebuilt his value and was then sold off to the Bucks to win a ring
* Lonzo Ball came from LA as a brick layer from 3 but after rebuilding his value he left asap to the Bulls to give them their best season in years

Now farmers in real life sadly dont make a massive earning and dont have a lot to show off just like the Pelicans who sold off all these assets recently and have a 1-10 record to show for it

However they have some new crops to sell off soon though

* Jonas Valuncius (Career year like Randle and Lonzo to secure bag)
* Zion (He up out of there asap)
* BI (He probably leaving also)"

472,Who is more likely to come right: Lakers or Nets?,"Not too long ago, both superteams would be considered the favorites of their respective conferences.

Now, the Lakers are having trouble with their offense, dropping some easy games and aren't gelling that quickly. LeBron is looking solid but due to missing time, isn't able to help his team.

The Nets meanwhile, have Kyrie missing for what might be the season or until he is traded and Harden is looking like the shell of his former self. KD is playing at an MVP level and is winning games by himself.

Who do you think bounces back stronger?"
473,Warriors are now ranked #2 in Offense,"After a rough start on offense with turnover issues and Jordan Poole being in a slump, the Warriors have improved to #2 in offensive eff, #1 in PPG, and #1 in Point Differential. Turnover rate has also dropped to 13.9 which is comparable to their title run years.

474,PGs under 25 that you think could win MVP?,"Just checked and apparently only 7 point guards have won the MVP award in the entire history of the NBA(Magic, Curry, Nash, Rose, Westbrook, Oscar & Cousy). 

And only three have won it more than once (Magicx3, Curryx2, Nashx2).


It seems PGs winning MVP is a rarity. So who, if any, do you think has the chance to win one with their current team? (not necessarily _this_ season, but assume their rosters would be vaguely similar to what they are rn).

Trae? Ja? LaMelo? Lonzo? Murray?"

He says the stats, records, and awards back him up. He also said in an interview back in 2019 he belongs in the Hall of Fame due to the work he has put in. At one point, he also had two girlfriends at the same time. Considering the Basketball Hall of Fame is considerably easier to get into than other sports, do you think Lou Will is right in saying he has a case?

482,"76ers have a 2 year championship window in their current state, they have to trade Simmons","76ers are over the cap this season. They're over the cap even more next season. The thing is, their roster is actually incredibly deep even if you forget Simmons. 


Curry, Green, Drummond, Niang, Maxey, and Korkmaz are all way outperforming their contracts. By the 2023-2024 season, all of those guys except Maxey and Korkmaz will have to be let go if Simmons is still on this team - they will be barely under the tax with only their max players and rookies. Green will probably washed but all the others will be just as good if not better, it would be dumb not to keep at least two of them for fucking Simmons. Trading Simmons will also grant cap relief they can use for other role players.


All this to say that Morey desperately needs Embiid to drag Philly to a chip this season or next, if he wants to play this Simmons situation out by icing him for 4 years (even if Simmons comes back, there's no way he will reach All-NBA level again, he's just gonna be a bad contract). The reality is that if the 6ers don't win a chip these next two playoff runs, they are not gonna go into the tax for a 4th year in a row with a roster that has a max player who refuses to play. At some point ownership is not gonna be okay with forking over $80m in luxury tax because Morey wants to win a petty war, when he could be tangibly improving championship aspirations by trading for quality players who aren't all stars."

493,I watched Paolo Banchero so you don’t have to…,"

A little premise, an asterisks. I’ve never watched much college ball outside of MM, and it’s super hard to separate what’s a plus because it’s actually an exceptional asset, or just because Paolo is 98th percentile athlete at the ncaa level. Here are my takeaways on the first take of watching Banchero


Let’s start with the Pros


First and foremost, really physically mature. His physique really jumps off the screen, a clear NBA body. His lower half especially looks powerful.

Movement is super fluid. Despite his large frame there is no burden in movement, he’s not labored when moving around the court, there’s an energy that always seems their, kind of like a coiled spring

On Ball defense. No problem staying in front of wings. Guards? Didn’t see too active hands but moved feet concisely and quickly, pretty clear he has the tools to be an elite defender, and that rare 1-5 switchability. Wouldn’t call him an elite rim protector on the capela gobert vein however.

Off ball defense - didn’t spot egregious mistakes but only watched live. Still nothing horrible happened

Mid Range - WOW. Had some really good looking shots. When he hits these, it looks like a go to weapon that can really translate to the league. His off the bounce ability to the hit the midrange was super intriguing. He was hitting difficult contested mid ranges. Had traces of Kawhi and AD at the elbow and mid block mid range. Beautiful shot here.

Free Throws - 8/9. Keep an eye on his season long percentage. Well documented that free throw success can translate to shooting success in the nba from long range.

Attacking the basket - His elite measurable let him overpower his defender in a lot of these situations. Also got him to the free throw line consistently. He’s like a force of nature when he has the defense on their heels and a little momentum behind him, not possible to stop only to foul. Out of the triple threat he has a really good looking rocker step

Low Post - against the skinny Kentucky wings, always looked like a mismatch in the post. Had a really nice hop step layup out of the low post that it looked like he tweaked something on. Came out of the game shortly after

Passing - more neutral than a pro. As much of a scoring force as he’s going to be, I don’t see many opportunities he’s going to get to flex any passing outside of transition and quick reads off double teams out of the post or off help as he attacks the balance. Something to keep an eye on

Cons:

Rebounding - Felt like with his athletic ability he should of been dominating the boards at this level. Didn’t see him as a + or - on the boards

Handle - Banchero definitely has a good handle for his size, but it is noticeably loose when 1) he’s going at full speed and 2) there’s either contact and/or traffic in the lane. Everytime he was dribbling into traffic it looked like a turnover waiting to happen.

Shake - Banchero had a couple opportunities in ISO to go at a set defense. His go to move was an in&out that didn’t seem to move the Kentucky defenders. Not sure if he has the handles and shake to beat a defender off the bounce and get to the rim, especially at the nba level. Would of loved to see him in the pnr as the primary ball handler, may not be in the cards

Shot selection - Before you come at me, it definitely wasn’t a problem today, because he was making everything. However… Given the size and girth of Banchero, it felt like he wasn’t getting inside enough. A lot of the time on offense was spent on the perimeter and running a pop out of a pick for the guard. I feel like that if Banchero sees a middie go in, he’s prone to settle for the shot rather fighting to go inside where he could really be an interior force. Will be interesting where he balances his mid range bag with attacking the bucket. Tonight it definitely wasn’t a problem because all of his middies were money, but on nights he’s not so hot I can see it being an inefficient habit

Three point shot - form looked decent, in the first half, he shot one off the catch and it was slightly off to the right with good power. He shot one off the dribble, missed badly. Second half when dealing with cramps - missed a three too strong off back rim.

Touch - His touch around the rim wasn’t exceptionally soft. No significant application of english and the ball was coming off the backboard and rim a little hard, something he could improve

Injury - honestly I’d rather make injury it’s own section outside of con because you can’t really blame injury on the player - but he did miss a large portion of the second half.

Overall there was definitely wow moments in his game. Also he was clearly given the spotlight on the team, in stark contrast to AJ Griffin who had limited run. The first nba player that came to mind when I was watching was John Collins. I also though of an unpolished Tatum as a good comparison. I saw a lot of Michael Beasley in his game as well. As this was my first time watching Banchero, it was impossible not to come away from the game super impressed. It’s definitely going to be a lot of fun debating him and Holmgren. Let me know what y’all think."
494,[Clip Request] Dame puts both his hands covering his face at the top of the key to mislead defense then takes the ball from a handoff from Nurk and scores,thought that the play was genius and Dame sold it really well and created space. Pretty sure LNJ set a screen up too.
495,Ideas With What's Wrong With The Blazers?,"A little while ago the TNT crew made the comment that Lilliard's cold streak is a lack of enthusiasm and passion on his part because the team sucks.   
We'll see if they can win this game against the Clippers but it's not looking good.  


Wondering if anyone has ideas with what is wrong with the Blazers? Just a few years ago they made deep playoff runs, they did well in the Bubble, last year CJ was cooking until getting hurt for a majority of the year, they've gotten better on D (at least they're not at the bottom of the league).  


Watching them play, they seem to rely a lot on Nurkić diving to the basketball when they trap Dame. I don't have the advanced stats on how well he's doing on those dives but it sure looks like he misses a lot of them. Other than that, I don't see exactly why they're doing so badly...other than that they just aren't doing great."
496,[Highlight] Hawks vs Jazz Full Game Highlights,
497,[Highlight] The floor opens up for Anfernee and he punishes the rim,
498,Shaq or Charles Barkley who is more famous.,I live in America but it’s seems to me shaq is more famous than Barkley. Because he played in LA which is a bigger market than Phoenix .
499,[Clip Request] Paul George up-and-down missed travel call at around 9:30 in the 3rd quarter against the the Trail Blazers,"Clip Request: Paul George up-and-down missed travel call at around 9:30 in the 3rd quarter against the the Trail Blazers

504,Kevin Durant this season has led the NBA in FG/G at 11.2 which is 1 more than second-place Paul George. He isn't even top 10 in FGA/G.,"This year Kevin Durant is making 11.2 FGM/G while attempting 19.7 FGA/G. This places him at 11th in the league despite leading the league in FGM/G by over 1 more than Paul George who is at 9.9. He is shooting 56% from the field to go along with 8.7 rebounds, and 5.3 assists. Amazing efficiency despite shooting just 83% from the FT line which is a career-low for him though that is sure to improve throughout the season.

Are we in for an MVP season and maybe a scoring title? This would be 8 years in between MVPs and Scoring Championships.

&#x200B;

With Curry's 9 3's against the Hawks, he is now the all time leader in total 3's made ever, in all forms of NBA games.

&#x200B;

Curry has made 2884 Regular Season 3s, 470 Playoff 3s and 12 Play In 3s for a combined total of 3366.

Ray Allen has made 2973 Regular Season 3s and 385 Playoff 3s for a combined total of 3358.

&#x200B;

Curry was behind by 1 prior to the Atlanta game, but he went off for 50 points, 10 assists and 7 rebounds, 3 steals and 9 3s for a nearly 75% TS% as a +31.

540,I analyzed every single assist in the NBA from 1996 to today - here are some fun results,"Yesterday there was a popular post about who LeBron assisted in his career so far. I thought it was a super cool concept, so I wrote a program to automate the process for an individual player and posted that yesterday. Today, I thought I'd take it a step further. I ran a webcrawler through every single game starting in 1996-1997 (when play-by-play data becomes available on basketball-reference.com) and created a dataset of every assist in the NBA during that time.

I did some analysis on the dataset, and I'll also share the dataset and the relevant programs here https://github.com/akarabat/allNBAAssists_1996_present



First, a nice table of the most popular connections from the past 26 season:

| Shooter | Assister | Number of assists |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Karl Malone | John Stockton | 1572 |
| Tim Duncan | Tony Parker | 1533 |
| Kevin Durant | Russell Westbrook | 1466 |
| Blake Griffin | Chris Paul | 1157 |
| Amar'e Stoudemire | Steve Nash | 1155 |
| Marc Gasol | Mike Conley | 1121 |
| David West | Chris Paul | 1120 |
| Klay Thompson | Stephen Curry | 962 |
| Richard Hamilton | Chauncey Billups | 934 |
| Richard Jefferson | Jason Kidd | 890 |


Some surprises here, CP3 to Blake was a bigger connection than I would have expected. Also didn't expect to see David West's name pop up. And Stockton and Malone top the charts despite only a few years of their time together existing in the data!



I also wrote a program that allows users to query an individual player and output a table with the players they assisted the most, and a table with the players who assisted them the most. Here are some examples using some of the NBA's top current players:

**Lebron James**

| Assists TO Player | Player Name |
|:------:|:------:|
| Zydrunas Ilgauskas | 785 |
| Kevin Love | 500 |
| Chris Bosh | 481 |
| Dwyane Wade | 428 |
| Drew Gooden | 356 |

| Assists FROM Player | Player Name |
|:------:|:------:|
| Dwyane Wade | 361 |
| Eric Snow | 292 |
| Mario Chalmers | 271 |
| Mo Williams | 228 |
| Kevin Love | 226 |




**Carmelo Anthony**

| Assists TO Player | Player Name |
|:------:|:------:|
| Nenê Hilário | 286 |
| Kenyon Martin | 255 |
| Marcus Camby | 197 |
| J.R. Smith | 182 |
| Kristaps Porziņģis | 124 |

| Assists FROM Player | Player Name |
|:------:|:------:|
| Andre Miller | 502 |
| Chauncey Billups | 315 |
| Marcus Camby | 308 |
| Nenê Hilário | 214 |
| J.R. Smith | 204 |




**Ben Simmons**

| Assists TO Player | Player Name |
|:------:|:------:|
| Joel Embiid | 290 |
| Tobias Harris | 250 |
| J.J. Redick | 215 |
| Dario Šarić | 179 |
| Robert Covington | 147 |


| Assists FROM Player | Player Name |
|:------:|:------:|
| Joel Embiid | 113 |
| Tobias Harris | 79 |
| J.J. Redick | 65 |
| T.J. McConnell | 46 |
| Jimmy Butler | 43 |


I also thought it would be funny to see where the biggest discrepancies were, that is, the largest differential between (assists from player A to player B) and (assists from player B to player A).

| More Baskets | More Assists | Size of Discrepency |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Kevin Durant | Russell Westbrook | 1099 |
| Amar'e Stoudemire | Steve Nash | 1077 |
| Karl Malone | John Stockton | 1059 |
| David West | Chris Paul | 958 |
| Blake Griffin | Chris Paul | 931 |
| Tim Duncan | Tony Parker | 820 |
| Klay Thompson | Stephen Curry | 775 |
| Shawn Marion | Steve Nash | 742 |
| Richard Hamilton | Chauncey Billups | 715 |
| Serge Ibaka | Russell Westbrook | 715 |


By its nature, this table is going to be kind of similar to the first table above. But the movements within it are interesting. KD taking passes from Westbrook and never returning the favor allows the pair to jump up to number one on the list, passing the Malone-Stockton duo. And another Westbrook duo pops up on the table! Timmy D shows the power of sharing and moves down on the list."

545,Laker fans what do you think of lebron fans?,This is brons 3rd teams and I just wonder what do y'all think of his fans. He definitely has the biggest and most vocal fan base how has his fans effected the fan base cause you know lebron fans don't care about the laker?

548,"Dwight Howard on being left off NBA 75: “I knew I wasn't going to be on it.” Taylor Rooks: “Why?” Dwight: “Politics. I already knew. I knew as soon as they made a 75 list, I said, 'Yeah, they ain't gonna put me on the 75 list.' Forget about it.”",
549,Will a player like Allen Iverson play on the same MVP level again?,"A lot of people see Iverson as a one of kind player, an undersized guard who was unstoppable despite his height. We've seen many players his height succeed in the league but he is still the smallest to ever win MVP. In the modern NBA the closest comparison would be Isaiah Thomas, but AI dominated for nearly a decade from his rookie year and was a consensus #1 pick. Is there ever going to be a player so good he gets picked number one regardless of height and just goes crazy in the league or size and physical attributes just much more important now?"
550,Steph Curry (+300) has taken a strong lead in the MVP race according to Vegas.,"Keeping track of odds as a way to gauge the MVP race. Luka started as the favorite with Giannis initially at 2nd. Then [Steph passed everyone](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qk1p2g/stephen_curry_550_has_now_passed_luka_doncic_650/).

And after dropping the first 50 piece of the season, Curry has taken a stronger lead. The Warriors are in sole possession of the best record in the league at 9-1. 

Curry (+300) is followed by Durant (+500), Giannis (+650), Doncic (+800), and Embiid/Jokic (+1500). Durant's odds have also shortened as he's gotten the Nets in position to overtake a top Eastern spot with fantastic individual showings. Giannis has stagnated as its tough to win games with your entire team injured. Despite the Mavs' solid record, Luka's odds lengthen as his slow individual start continues. Jokic for sure deserves more love though, I think he's been individually playing better than anyone. 

After these players sits Ja Morant at +2200. We'll see if his odds continue to rise or if he falls down to Earth."

- Seth Curry - Foot contusion

- Isaiah Joe - COVID-19

- Joel Embiid - COVID-19

- Grant Riller - Meniscus tear"
552,What technically fair trade could be made that would nonetheless piss off both sets of fans?,"Basically, how could you make an evenish trade that would somehow not work for either team or alienate their fanbase? 

I'd say an example would be if the Lakers did a reverse AD trade and traded him for a bunch of young players/draft picks that won't reach their prime until LeBron is gone"
553,"Deandre Ayton has not played a game since Jalen Rose reported Robert Sarver called him a ""lazy n-word""","Video of Jalen's Allegation: https://streamable.com/45hv6x

Since this revelation on television Ayton has missed the past 3 games with a ""leg contusion"" which was apparently reaggravated after this story came out, with no date yet set for return. Ayton is confirmed to be out of tomorrow's game vs the Blazers. 
 
Entirely plausible Ayton is sitting out because of Sarver's alleged comments and may not return until the Sarver situation is dealt with. Don't blame him whatsoever, if Sarver said this he needs to be banned immediately."
554,How many more points could KAJ score if he was drafted at 19?,Kareem went 4 years in college. Yet he's the all time scoring leader as he played for so long. How much better would it be if he was drafted at 19 instead like a one and done player.
555,Who is the best player that started their career off playing the worst?,"We all know of second round draft picks who exceed their expectations in that regard, but which players were terrible to start their career but eventually become a minor or major contributor?

Jordan Poole might be the most recent example for me, but who else comes to mind?"
556,NBA Week 3 Imperialism Map,"Map [here](https://imgur.com/a/LgOZfyL)

Hello. This is the third week of my imperialism map. It’s technically semi-imperialism because it isn’t a true imperialism map because the winning team doesn’t take all of the territory from the losing team, just some of it.

If you don’t know how this works, here’s an explanation: Each team starts out with the counties closer to their arena than any other team’s. If a team beats another team, the winning team annexes a portion of the losing team’s territory. The formula for how many counties are taken is as follows: (MOV/Losing team’s points)*losing team’s counties.

Because of the way this is structured, the map will start out chaotic for the first few weeks. Teams like Minnesota and Utah are given an unfair advantage to start off. This advantage will dwindle as time goes on and the territories balance out. Also, there will be a lot of areas with 3 or fewer counties. This will also hopefully happen less and less as the season goes on.

Another result of the formula is that it is very hard for a team to disappear completely from the map. I think this is fine because it will leave teams in the game for longer, which is more fun.

Let me know if you have any feedback, I’m pretty new to this!

Table for number of counties (numbers aren’t completely accurate):

|Team|# of Counties|
:--|--:|
|Utah|207|
|Denver|205|
|Washington|193|
|Indiana|179|
|Minnesota|170|
|Chicago|160|
|Philadelphia|153|

|New Orleans|27|

Also, here’s a table showing percent increase from last week. I think this number shows a pretty accurate measure of how good of a week team had compared to usual. Obviously, this number will better reflect that as the season goes along.

560,This stretch of bad regular season games is doing more to Westbrook's reputation than 5 years of terrible playoff performances," 

He is probably a little worse than the years before but not by much. The consensus on him is only changing because that he is on the Lakers, and they have a huge fanbase.

Before this the westbrook fans could make whatever narrative they want because they were the dominant fanbase. That westbrook dragged wizards to the playoff despite beal being their clear best player, and they didn't even have a positive record. That all the playoff terrible performances are fine because his team is not good, so it excuses him being terrible.

As bad as he is right now , it's not worse than the last playoff vs 76ers , not worse than the rocket vs lakers series, not worse than when he shot his team out of the season vs Portland when his team was shooting 60 percent beside him.

It's so dumb that the opinion on westbrook is changing so fast despite him being the same player. I said that he is not a top 10 point guard before the season and was downvoted to hell. That he is not better than jamal murray or lowry, not even better than conley and it was considered blasphemy.

It's crazy that this stretch of bad games is doing more to westbrook's reputation than the last 5 years of terrible playoff performances. This is only because of laker's huge fanbase."
561,[Spears] Knicks star Julius Randle visited the Earl Monroe New Renaissance Basketball School in the Bronx today to announce his #30 for 3 pledge of $500 for every 3-pointer he makes this season to the high school’s literacy and math intervention programs.,

Big Saints city with not much excitement for Pelicans basketball unfortunately.

566,Pippen over Kawhi for defense?,"For ppl who have Pippen over Kawhi has a better wing defender, just curious for the reasoning? I feel like Kawhi would be amazing in that era with the hand checking rule, but curious about why ppl put scottie over Kawhi as a better defender?"
567,"If the league stuck to the best of 5 in the first round, how many championships could have changed?","Vice Versa as well, many teams that lost 3-1 or 3-2 in the first round then may have been able to come back to win 4-3. It’s kind of wild to think about the title shifts it could have had back then in a best of 7 and today in a best of 5"
568,"Early season best players/early MVP frontrunners: Durant, Curry, Jokic, PG,","Kevin Durant:

29.5/8.7/5.3 on 57/38/83 shooting splits(.655 TS)

Dragging a Nets team with an underperforming Harden and missing anti-vaxxer

Steph Curry:

27.6/6.6/6.6/1.6 on 43/39/98 shooting splits(.615)

While the shooting isn't as insane as it normally is his defense this has been great and he's helping contributing well on that end to make the Warriors so deadly on both sides of the ball.

Paul George:

27/8.2/5.2/2.7 on 46/36/88 shooting splits(.58 True shooting)

Slightly worse numbers than KD, but he's been leading a team missing Kawhi with stellar defense and has already had a few clutch performances this year. 

Jokic: 25.4/13.6/5.7/1.6/1 on 60/40/79 shooting splits(.69 true shooting)

Dragging a team missing Murray and an underperforming and now hurt MPJ once again by him damn self. His shooting is amazing, his efficiency is amazing, his passing is amazing, Jokic is amazing and is again continuing his great clutch play this year.

Shoutouts to Embiid, Butler, and Ja too for great play this year.


Feel free to add who you've felt is your team's early season standout."
569,Who is a player that the NBA world deems “fun to watch” that you can’t stand watching,For me it is definitely lamelo ball. He has so much talent driving to the rim and he settles for 30 footers so much. If you only watch his highlights this guy is must see Tv but he is so frustrating to me live. Another would definitely be Westbrook.  I don’t appreciate the narrative “plays hard every possession” when this guy has all the physical tools to be the best pg defender and is a actually liability. Not to mention the 3-4 mid ranges he takes that are ugly even when they go in.
570,"With all the Markief Morris chatter about him being a fake tough guy, who are some legit tough guys across NBA History?","I'll start with some ABA names and older guys who were famous for being willing to beat the piss out of you, but probably won't get mentioned.

- Wendel Ladner, Dr. J's muscle. Died in a plane crash before the merger with the NBA and was only identifiable by his Nets championship ring.

- John Brisker. Famously fucking insane, probably died when Idi Amin's government collapsed in Africa.

- Mel Daniels. Plain and simple, he didn't back down from a fight.

- Al Attles. 6 feet tall, and yet was Wilt Chamberlain's body guard during their time on the Warriors.

- Willis Reed & Wes Unseld. Stone giants of 70s basketball, these two were built like brick walls and beat the shit out of each other at the start of the decade. Their 1971 ECF slugfest is why the 1971 Finals sucked so damn much; the Bullets were all injured from playing the Knicks, while the Bucks walked down a playoff run of a Lakers team missing West and Baylor and a Warriors team still floundering after Rick Barry jumped to the ABA. These two didn't go looking for fights from what I've heard, but they never backed down from any either. And you've all seen that Lakers clip by now, right?"

573,"Would you rather give team 32 to the city of Seattle, Tampa Bay or Pittsburgh?","The NBA expansion will eventually happen within the next decade and team 31 is for sure going to Las Vegas without a doubt because of how much money is there which leaves 32 up for grabs between a few cities. The biggest cities without an NBA team are Seattle, Tampa Bay and Pittsburgh. Which one would be better off with an NBA team?

Seattle use to have the SuperSonics but they left after a decline in interest from the city and fans forcing them to leave for OKC.

Tampa Bay has 3 other major sports franchises (Buccaneers, Rays, Lightning) and having an NBA would complete their sports resume.

Pittsburgh also has 3 major sports franchises (Steelers, Pirates, Penguins) and they are a big and historic sports city so having an NBA team there would make sense."
574,"The biggest surprises of the season to 538's NBA model: Cavs (+9), Warriors (+8), and Pelicans (-11)","After around 10 games in to the season, the biggest surprises to the Nate Silver model thus far appear to be the Cavs, Warriors, and Pelicans. 

The Cavs are surging, led by a rookie who appears to be an all time great in the making. 

The Warriors are #1 in the NBA, and are now projected to do 8 wins better than their preseason projection predicted. 

The Pelicans, on the other hand, are dead last and are now projected to do 11 wins worse than projected. 

From the preseason thread, a lot of people seemed to doubt the Lakers projection being so low. But it turns out that one may have been an *over* estimate, the model now has the Lakers doing 3 games worse than initially projected: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/q819je/538_202122_nba_predictions/

576,Which players are terrible by every metric from the eye test to advanced stats?,"There are some players who just suck. Bad on one or both ends of the floor, lineups clearly looks worse with them playing, terrible on/off splits and advanced stats. 

My vote is for Kelly Oubre. Besides that one year in Phoenix I think he's played losing basketball wherever he's been. His offense is usually pretty bad. He has severe tunnel vision which results in a lack of creation for his teammates, bad turnovers, and forcing many difficult shots. His defensive IQ could also use work. But I guess he plays with energy?"

looking for facts, i went to [basketball-reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/50-point-game-most-times.html),

there are 62 players to have at least two 50+ points games in their career.

Anything stick out ? Warriors seem to both have a very easy schedule and been fortunate with injuries to players. 

Miami has played extremely well considering they’ve had a pretty tough schedule. Wizards and cavs appear to be doing well against a tough schedule, impressive signs for them. 

Knicks might be a team punching above their weight right now. They got fortunate with injuries to the bucks and sixers when they played them and played depleted magic pacers and raptors teams."
581,NBA Monthly Pass By Team,"I recently realized some other NBA teams other than Orlando Magic also have the monthly pass thing going. So I came up with a spreadsheet for all the teams with the monthly pass equivalent.

(I cannot post screenshot here so you can click the link above)

Here are the general themes I observed:

1. Most of them cost $49/month upperbowl, with at least 4-5 games per month. This is way cheaper than single tickets.
2. There are real possibilities to upgrade to lower bowl seats.
3. Playoff teams usually don't sell monthly pass probably because they have the demand already. But you can still find emerging teams like Cavs and Kings having them.
4. Cavs is the only one selling lower bowl monthly passes, while Timberwolves has the lowest price."
582,"[OC]The case for and against Giannis, Steph, KD, LeBron, or Jokic as the best player in the world right now","Note: Obviously everyone knows my personal bias, but I'll try to be as impartial as possible

Right now, the title of ""best player in the world"" is more up for grabs than it's been since before LeBron's first ring. However, it seems like five players are often viewed as a tier above everyone else currently. So here's the case for and against each of them being the #1 at the moment

**Giannis:**

**The case for:** How can you say that anyone but the guy who averaged 30/13/5 with elite defense in the playoffs, and 35/13/5 on 62% shooting in the Finals(including a 50 bomb to close it out) is the best in the world right now? With LeBron's defensive decline, he's by far the best two way player out of the potential candidates as well. With 2 MVPs, a ring, an FMVP, and a DPOY over 3 years, he's already well on his way to soaring up the all time lists as well.

**The case against:** Giannis has had only one consistent playoff run in his career, and it came when everyone else got hurt. Even so, they still were one point away from a second round exit. Also, the Bucks are far more stacked than people would think, with Giannis having some of the best #2 and #3 players in the league. This showed when they were able to beat the Hawks twice without him. Giannis is a great player, of course, but he's not the best until he beats healthy teams.

**Steph:**

**The case for:** Steph is by far the best offensive player in the league right now. Last year, he averaged 32.0 PPG on 65.5% TS with zero spacing at all. Over the past few years in general, the only scorer as efficient as him as been KD, who doesn't bring nearly as much in terms of playmaking. Now that he has an actual team, the Warriors look like top title contenders again despite Steph not having an experienced second option and still being by far the main focus of the defense. This shows how much he can elevate a team. By advanced stats, he's arguably been the best player in the league since 2015, and this shows it. 

**The case against:** No player in NBA history has gotten more praise for missing the playoffs than Steph did last season. Shouldn't the ""best offensive player in the league"" be able to carry a team to more than 20th in ORTG and not miss the playoffs despite being gifted a top 5 defense by his teammate Draymond Green? Despite his defense being better so far this season, time has proven that it's a liability when it actually matters, as shown by when he got targeted by Ja Morant in the play in. In the end, he's the best shooter by far, but his all around game is somewhat overstated and isn't good enough to truly be the best. For someone who is supposed to elevate his teammates, his floor raising ability should be a lot better. 

**KD:**

**The case for:** By raw statistics, you could argue that nobody tops him right now. Since moving to Brooklyn, he's averaged 28/8/6 on an otherworldly 66.3% TS in the regular season(basically a normal LeBron statline but with far more efficiency) and 34/9/4 on 63.0% TS in his only playoff run. Although often maligned for being ""just a scorer"", he's also become an above average playmaker and defender, being an important piece in a Nets defense that was expected to be horrible being top 10 so far. Overall, he might actually be hitting his all around peak right now at 33 in almost every area except raw speed. How scary is that for the rest of the league?

**The case against:** The ""raw statistics"" mentioned are only box score stats. When you include on/off stats such as RAPTOR and RAPM, they are far less kind to him, in fact painting him as basically only a borderline top 10 player since his MVP season. His meh on/off numbers are in fact a product of his inability to elevate his teammates, even when his individual stats are amazing. In the end, his best player case basically rests on what ultimately was a second round exit. Overall, he may have the best stats and be the best individual player, but he's not the best in terms of winning. 

**LeBron:**

**The case for:** It's still not proven that a healthy LeBron ISN'T the best player when it really counts(the playoffs.) He's just more than 12 months away from winning a finals MVP. Although his regular season impact isn't quite as big(at least defensively), he's still very impactful when healthy there, finishing 2nd in MVP in 19/20 and being one of the leading contenders before getting hurt last year. His playmaking is still on a completely different level from anyone else here, and in the end would you really want to bet against him come playoff time?

**The case against:** LeBron even being on this list, as well as him even being considered for MVP last year, was solely a function of his name. He's severely declined from his peak in several ways. For one, once one of the most efficient high volume scorers in the league has been only moderately above average in that department since joining LA(not even close to Curry or KD and even behind Giannis). Another part that's declined is his defensive effort, with him basically coasting for half the game every time. Finally, he had one of his ugliest playoff series in years last year. He scored 30 in no game, even with his co-star out, quit on defense, averaged 23 on subpar efficiency(56.4% vs 57.2% average), and got outplayed by Devin Booker. You may say it was because he's hurt, but he's had injuries in 3 out of 4 Lakers seasons now. Is this just who he is now? In the end, LeBron is an absolute legend and a top 2 player of all time, but he's simply not the best at this point in his career.

**Jokic:**

**The case for:** He's arguably been the best player all the way since the bubble(where he had 24/10/6 on 61.4% TS and DIDN'T have each other like LeBron and AD did.) Over the past two seasons, both his impact and box score numbers have been ridiculous. He's by far the best playmaking big in the league and most likely the best ever, which makes him impact the game in a unique way that no one else can truly replicate. He also has by far the worst team of these players, especially with Murray out. Despite this, he was still able to win a playoff round with no co-star, which Steph, KD, and LeBron failed to do.

**The case against:** It's hard to be called the best player in the world when you got swept in a playoff series by a Suns team that was good but hardly all-timers. In that series, he put up huge volume numbers but on 53% TS and got exploited on defense. In addition, his track record is minuscule compared to everyone else here. He may be playing like the best currently, but he's still got a lot to prove before being ranked that high."

Mikal in the playoffs: 35/95, 36.8%

With a sample size north of 400 attempts, it is now statistically significant enough to begin drawing conclusions about Mikal’s improvement as a 3pt shooter.

Coming out of Villanova, Mikal was seen as one of the best (if not the best) shooters in the 2018 draft class. However, after an [unsightly hitch found its way into his shot form](https://youtu.be/xYzyJj28ipY), Mikal’s rookie season was disappointing from behind the 3pt line (but not elsewhere), shooting just 33.5% on just 3.8 attempts per game, down from 43.5% on 6 attempts per game in college.

The narrative began to shift away from Mikal being a knockdown 3pt shooter, and it only further shifted after his 2nd year. Despite increasing to 36.1% from distance, his attempts/game dropped all the way down to 2.7, not even half of his attempts/game from college. 

In this time, Mikal expanded his game outside of the 3pt line, becoming an incredibly effective off ball cutter, fast break finisher, and occasional attacker of the dribble. We saw his shot attempts within 3 feet of the basket take a huge rise, shooting 39% of his shots from that distance, over 10% higher than any other year in his short career. This allowed him to add legitimate value to our offense despite worse-than-expected shooting, getting 9 ppg on 62% TS. 

Last year, in his 3rd year in the league, Mikal took a significant step in 3pt shooting. He raised his 3pt% by 8% and increased his attempts/game by 1.7, leading to 42.5% on 4.4 attempts. This amazing step solidified Mikal as a top 2-3 3pt shooter on the Suns, which only further aided the team’s success last year. Shooting that well only further opened up his game, upping his averages to 13.5 ppg on an absurdly efficient 66.7% TS. 

This incredible shooting improvement has continued into this year, where Mikal has continued to shoot 40+% on 4 attempts a game. The work Mikal put into being an effective off ball offensive player, despite not coming into the league as the knockdown shooter we thought he was, has lead to him taking a significant step offensively now that those shots are falling. 

With Mikal taking other steps offensively to start off the year (mid range pull ups, attacking smaller defenders off the drive and in the post, general shot creation), he has officially become the 3 and D player Suns fans thought he would... but now he’s even more than that.

**95.4 total points scored per 100 shot attempts** \- 23rd percentile for the entire league and the lowest of his career. His last 3 seasons were 102.0, 107.7, and 100.2.

**17.5% Turnover Percentage** \- 26th percentile for the entire league. By far the highest turnover percentage of his career. His 2nd highest through a full season was 16.0% during his rookie year.

**45.5% Effective Field Goal Percentage** \- 29th percentile for the entire league and the lowest of his career since his 2nd season. League average is usually between 52-54% and Russ's last three seasons were 47.6%, 49.3%, and 46.9%.

**26.8% Three Point Percentage** \- 9th percentile for the entire league and the 2nd lowest of his career since his 2nd season. Last year Russ show 31.2% from deep.

**61.0% Free Throw Percentage** \- the ZERO percentile for the entire league and the lowest of his career by far. During his best years he shot around or above 80%. The last three years, however, he has show 65.9%, 76.6%, and 65.9%.

**45% of his shot attempts are coming at the rim (100th percentile leaguewide) BUT he is only making 54% of those shots (34th percentile league wide)** \- This is the lowest of his career since his second season. The last three seasons he show 65%, 61%, and 63% on shots at the rim.

**14.1 Player Efficiency Rating** \- BY FAR the lowest of Russ's career. 15 is considered league average, over 20 is considered All Star, and over 25 is considered All NBA / MVP contention. Here's Russ's last 5 seasons before this year, starting with 2016-17 - 30.6 (led the NBA), 24.7, 21.1, 21.0, 19.5.

**-2.4 offensive box score plus/minus, -1.3 defensive box score plus/minus, -3.6 overall box score plus/minus** \- this stat describes how many points per 100 possessions a player contributes over a league average player on a league average team. All of these numbers are BY FAR the worst of Russ's career. At his highest powers in 2016-17 those numbers were 8.7 (offense), 2.4 (defense), and 11.1 (overall). Last year he was at 2.5 (offense), 0.8 (defense), and 3.4 (overall). This is the first time since his rookie season he has been negative in all three.

**-0.2 Value Over Replacement Player** \- by far the lowest of his career, he has NEVER been in the negative. This stat estimates the points per 100 team possessions that a player contributes above a replacement level player on an average team. Here's Russ's last 5 seasons before this year, starting with 2016-17 - 9.3 (led the NBA), 6.1, 4.7, 1.8, 3.2.

It’s one thing to reach for the ball and foul, but the amount of times people just wrap up the ball handler, or in this case, body check them is staggering. The game is more fun with less foul calls, and especially more fun when running in transition, in my opinion. It seems obvious to me that the answer is calling intentional fouls as what they are… if an attempt isn’t made on the ball it should be two free throws and the ball back.

The number of realistic takers is slim, according to the executives polled. The consensus is a team that’s a title contender or an executive who’s desperate to make a big splash would be the most likely fit.

>“I would’ve said Philly legitimately made sense with the swap of Ben Simmons and Kyrie,” one of the executives told HoopsHype. “That’s a team I could’ve seen who’s going for it and needs a scoring guard. That’s literally the only one I could see.”

>Three of the executives believed an Irving-for-Simmons trade could make some sense but ultimately wouldn’t happen. In theory, from a geographical perspective, it would keep Irving close to New Jersey, where he has family ties, and allow him the opportunity to play with a dominant big man, Joel Embiid, in pick-and-roll action and spread the floor more efficiently for the 76ers.

>The Nets would get a defensive stopper, something the team desperately needs. However, Simmons would be a bad fit next to Kevin Durant and James Harden because he needs the ball in his hands to be effective, and there’s no scenario where Durant and Harden won’t have the ball in their hands as primary playmakers.

>“I don’t think they can trade him,” one executive said bluntly. “I think they’re just stuck. I don’t think it makes sense for anybody. I’m not aware of any team that wants him.”

>In another light, there’s no better place for Irving to succeed than Brooklyn, according to the executives, minus the vaccine mandate.

>“Brooklyn is probably the only team in the league that can carry him in the locker room, tolerate the PR demands, and maintain fan support,” another executive told HoopsHype. “They’re one of the only teams in the league where he’s not one of their best two players. He also enticed Durant to Brooklyn, and he deserves credit for that. There’s a shared responsibility for his absence with the city’s vaccination mandate.”

Plus/minus is not a perfect statistic by any means, and it is often used as an index of individual performance like counting stats. That's NOT what I intend to do here. I think single game +/- figures can reflect interesting things that are not immediately obvious about games from the headlines. Which players made a two-way impact? Which players are part of particularly useful rotations? When did teams win games?

Most of the past 5 games have been relatively close until the Warriors turn it on with a huge 3rd quarter run.

In total they've outscored their opponents 163 - 87 in the 3rd quarter alone, averaging out to 32.6 - 17.4, a 15 point margin in **one quarter**--which would work out to a score of about 130 - 70 score over the course of a 4 quarters game if they only played the third.

633,"Through the first 10 Games, the Golden State Warriors are outscoring opponents by a league-best 13.7 points per game. Most of this comes from 3rd quarters, where the Warriors are outscoring opponents by a whopping 9.4 points per game.","The Golden State Warriors are outscoring opponents by 13.7 points per game, and 9.4 points per game in 3rd quarters. Their net rating in 3rd quarters (per 100 possessions) is a whopping +36.3. 

For reference, the next closest point differential for one quarter belongs to the Miami Heat in 1st quarters, outscoring opponents by 6.3 points per game. In the 3rd quarter, the next closest team is the Denver Nuggets, outscoring opponents by 4.4 points per game. 

The Warriors have also won each of their last five 3rd quarters by double digits.

Here are the Warriors' 3rd quarter point differentials through the first 10 games:

* @ Lakers: +4
* vs. Clippers: -2
* @ Kings: +4
* @ Thunder: +16
* vs. Grizzlies: -4
* vs. Thunder: +13
* vs. Hornets: +12
* vs. Pelicans: +18
* vs. Rockets: +12
* vs. Hawks: +21

Given that much of their early schedule is an extended homestand with a number of weaker teams, I'm fully expecting these numbers to drop, but this is still remarkable how well they play after halftime, especially against teams with how they've held teams like the Hornets and Hawks who have a lot of offensive firepower in check. The eye test definitely matches the stats - close games at halftime will often be blown open to 20+ point leads by the time the 4th quarter rolls around.

And tonight at home 9/13 FG 7/10 from 3 


Lakers are gonna have to do good in the regular season if they want Home Court Advantage Melo"
647,"Without Carmelo Anthony, the Lakers might legitimately have a 1-10 record this season (1-16 including preseason)","https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2022/gamelog/

They have 6 wins this season. In 5 of those 6 wins: 

1. 121-118 vs Grizzlies: Carmelo scored 28 points on 88.2% TS. LeBron and Westbrook had a terrible game. 

2. 113-101 vs Cavaliers: Carmelo scored 24 points on 100% TS. He was absolutely pivotal. LeBron and others had a mediocre game. 

3. 95 - 85 vs Rockets: Carmelo scored 23 points on 73% TS. Again, another ridiculous night when the Big 3 averaged something like 18 points on 43% TS. If we discount intentional late fouls in these close games, we see these games were closer than they look. 

4. 119-117 vs Rockets: Carmelo scored 15 points on 83.3% TS. Not as high volume as the other games but the game was only won off of 2 points not even accounting for late game fouls. This is insane efficiency even for 15 points. The big 3 averaged 90 on good efficiency this game and it was still down to the wire. 

5. 126-123 vs Hornets: This was tonight's game. Carmelo scored 29 points on mind boggling 95.4% TS. 7 three pointers. 

These are 5 games with extremely close point differential where Carmelo's efficiency was pivotal. You could optimistically discount 2 of them but 3 are undeniable. Teams are also respecting Melo's shot more which has progressively led to better spacing, in fact Melo does have the best +/- out of players with 10 games besides Malik Monk. 

Out of all the players on the Lakers, Carmelo has the highest TS% at 63% on solid 16.5 points per game. The second highest is Austin Reaves on much lower volume at 62% TS. LeBron, AD, and Westbrook are at 56%, 54.7%, and 47.3% respectively. He is carrying the Lakers this season, without a doubt. 

In conclusion, this is potentially a 1-10 record without Melo playing god level efficiency. They went 0-6 in the preseason playing their best players 30+ minutes which suggests to me this isn't a coincidence.

**For people saying LeBron would make a difference:**

I explain LeBron and AD's stats in each of these wins. Even when they played well Melo was critical in the wins. And there were plenty of games when LeBron and AD did not play well at all. 2 out of the 6 wins have been without LeBron but against higher caliber teams. LeBron has had 3 bad games against the better teams - Cavaliers and Memphis - and great games against Houston who are 1-9. And even in those games, I have showed Melo was critical. 

LeBron only has 6 games played. If we restrict the sample size so that Carmelo's schedule overlaps with LeBron, LeBron has a net rating of 2.9 and Carmelo has a net rating of 3 on 8 games, the highest on the team behind Reaves.

656,"[OC] Joker, Brodie, and the 'Gordie Howe triple-double'","In hockey, a much-loved unofficial achievement is scoring a goal, getting an assist, and getting into a fight, known as the 'Gordie Howe hat-trick'. Some of you may know Gordie Howe as the man named 'Mr Hockey', or as the source of [the picture](https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/oX1i7jb9kVPE5zMBSTHafz1R1tc=/1280x0/smart/frinkiac.com/meme/S03E16/1304184.jpg) Bart used to fool Mrs Krabappel in 'Bart the Lover'. In his career, Gordie only achieved the feat twice; the all-time leader is Rick Tocchet with 18, which goes to show how rare it is ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordie_Howe_hat_trick)).

There's never been a perfect equivalent in basketball, probably because as Ron Artest once observed, fighting might lead players to get in trouble ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Malice_at_the_Palace)). But with Jokic getting a triple-double and an ejection today I thought that wasn't a bad starting point.

Ejections are hard to quantify in free-to-use statistical databases, although Jokic is the second player this season to be ejected after achieving a triple-double. Russel Westbrook was ejected on October 27 when the Thunder hosted the Lakers - he had 20 points, 13 assists, 14 boards, 10 turnovers, and got ejected after taking exception to Darius Bazley's late-game breakaway dunk ([Source](https://www.nba.com/game/lal-vs-okc-0022100061/play-by-play?period=Q4)). If anyone knows of other triple-double ejections or can find some on other databases, please let me know.

However, the NBA database records 30 times a player fouled out after getting a triple double, which you can access [here](https://www.nba.com/stats/search/player-game/?CF=PTS*gt*10%7CREB*gt*10%7CAST*gt*10%7CPF*gt*6&sort=GAME_DATE&dir=1). Brodie has done it three times, with three different teams; Domantas Sabonis, Nikola Jokic and Chris Webber are the only other players to have done it multiple times, each having done it twice. Magic, MJ, Giannis, KD, Lebron and Luka have all done it once."
657,Carmelo Anthony tonight: 29 points against the other Melo!,"Carmelo had:

- 29 points

- 7 made 3-pointers

659,"[Wind] Nikola Jokic: “I thought it was a dirty foul, a dirty shot. Me and Bam were fighting the whole night. It was a nice fight. I think you can play fair and still play aggressive and fight with your guy. But I thought it was a little over the edge. That’s why I reached.”",

Who would have thought that the GOAT and Kevin Durant had the same number of baskets assisted by Steph"
661,[Highlight] Miles Bridges hits the game tying 3 with 23.7 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.,
662,[Highlight] Anthony Davis airballs the go ahead shot attempt,
663,[Highlight] LaMelo Ball shoots 5 free throws in a row after a foul and 3 straight technicals on the Lakers,
664,Steph Curry is the oldest player in NBA History to drop 50 Points and 10 Assists. He's the 10th player to do it since the NBA-ABA merger. (Side note: Harden did it 8 times),"Steph passes Wilt as the oldest to ever hit the statline.

Stephen Curry Once

Kevin Porter Jr. Once

Damian Lillard Three times

Nikola Jokic Once

James Harden Eight times.

Russell Westbrook Three times.

LeBron James Twice.

Tony Parker Once.

Stephon Marbury Once.

Michael Jordan Once.


Worth noting that Rick Barry, Elgin Baylor, Kareem, and Nate Archibald hit the line before the merger too, but they're not on statmuse. Wilt probably did it another 20 times.

665,What does Curry need to do to surpass Magic Johnson on the All time standings?,"I feel like an mvp, finals mvp and a chip this year will put him right there with Magic, but everyone might not feel the same way.

What do you guys think?"
666,[Highlight request] LaMelo Ball shoots 5 free throws in a row after the refs call 3 straight technicals on the Lakers.,"Towards the end of Lakers vs Hornets, after a foul on LaMelo, the refs called two technicals on the Lakers and a delay of game. This, in addition to the original two free throws, gave LaMelo five free throws in a row, which he made."
667,if curry got the scoring title and fmvp this year? would it firmly put him as the 2nd great pg ever?,so curry is an all time great guard. if he got the scoring title again (would that be his 4th?) and also got the fmvp. would this be place him as the second greatest pg ever? and how close would he be to magic?
668,The Hawks are 4-7 and 1-6 on away games. What's the issue?,People were really high on them before the start of the season. Is there cause for concern based on the slow start?
669,The Warriors are 9-1 despite none of their 3 lottery picks in the recent drafts playing significant rotation minutes,"If they had decided to trade Wiseman, Moody, and/or Kuminga for a win-now type player, who do you think they could have gotten, and how would that Warriors team look now?"
670,"After tonight's games, Steph Curry(27.6 PPG) and Kevin Durant(29.5 PPG) are currently 2nd and 1st in scoring, both on insane efficiency. Is it fair to consider them on their own tier apart from the rest of the league as scorers right now?","Obviously they were always two of the best, but in previous years them being the ""two best"" could be disputed by Houston Harden and in the playoffs also LeBron

But recently, it seems like nobody can really come close to matching both their volume AND efficiency"
671,[Highlight] Hawks vs Warriors Full Game Highlights,
672,[Highlight] Melo drains his 6th three pointer to give him 26 pts,
673,[Highlight] Suns vs Kings Full Game Highlights,

675,[Highlight] Rajon Rondo Ejected For Foul on Terry Rozier,
676,Are the Warriors contenders this year?,The Warriors are 9-1 and Steph Curry seems to be going crazy recently. Are they serious contenders for a ring this season? Would a 60 win season be possible?
677,What's up with Clint Capela?,"He is really having a putrid start to the season. The only people I see talking about this are some hawks fans on Twitter, but I'm very concerned. Anyone know why he is sucking so bad?"

> At 33 years old, Stephen Curry is the oldest player in NBA history with 50 points and 10 assists in a game.

Absolutely crazy that LeBron James never did this at age 33 when he was on those teams where he needed to carry."

> He added that Morris fouled Jokic but said Jokic executed a “dangerous, dirty play… It’s absolutely uncalled for.”

The Jokic Morris Heat saga continues. Since there are no player interviews for the Heat maybe butler did go to the back to kick jokic’s ass.

Other commentator has to calm him down and explain it's a big deal for a player even with all his accolades.

687,"Steph Curry checks out with 50/10/7 with 3 steals (14/28 FG, 9/19 3PT, 13/13 FT) on team high +32 against the Hawks","https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/401359976 

Steph Curry checks out with 50/10/7 with 3 steals (14/28 FG, 9/19 3PT, 13/13 FT) on team high +32 against the Hawks. Approximately 74% TS. 

- This is the first 50 point game of the season

- He is 50/51 from free throws so far. How fitting. 

- 10 assists on 2 turnovers, 7 rebounds. Sorry I swapped the numbers by accident

- He is now at 27.6 PPG which is 2nd in the NBA (behind KD's 29.5 points) and jumped from #11 to #2 over night. Was in a slump for a while so going back to his averages.

- Among players with 20+ min played on 9+ games, Curry leads the league in net rating (points per 100 possession when on court) after this game at 16.9. Players just below him are Aaron Gordon, Monte Morris, Derrick Rose, and Jokic. 

- Check out freedawkins for the best un-butchered highlight"
688,Is Harden's game taking a hit because of the new rules?,I haven't watched him play but know his stats are down. There's certain things he's not allowed to do and I think the new rules were mostly changed because of him. He's probably still not recovered from his hamstring also.

708,James Harden struggling this year.,His offensive numbers are way way down. Is Harden past his prime?  Or does the beard need to get warmed up ?
709,Jonas Valanciunas is 11/19 from 3PT this season," [https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/\_/id/6477/jonas-valanciunas](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/6477/jonas-valanciunas)

Has hit for at least one 3 in 6 straight games and is 10/16 in that span. He should shoot more, unfortunately NOLA sucks badly at the moment with Ingram and Zion out and they choose to play him in the paint more, but once Zion and BI are back and he will be used more to stretch the floor for Zion, other teams better watch out.

Watching him since he was 14yo and never thought he could be this lethal from the long range, he's becoming like Gasol and Brook Lopez in this aspect of the game. JV, you beautiful monster!"
710,Do you ever stop being crushed when your team loses a game?,"I just recently have really gotten into the NBA and started watching every single one of my team’s games. Every time they lose it honestly kind of crushes me for the rest of the night and into the next day. Do loses affect you less the longer you’re a fan?

EDIT: I can still have a great night when they lose y’all, just wondering if it’ll matter less. Appreciate the comments"

712,[Highlight] Curry hits an opportunistic three to give him 16 points in the first quarter,
713,"Ayo Dosunmu goes for 15 points with 7 rebounds on 6/10 FG, 1/4 from 3, and 2/3 from FT line","He also leads the team with +22 in 20 minutes alongside only 1 turnover, finishing on a career high of points.

As the 38th pick in the draft, Dosunmu makes a strong performance for himself and is proving to be a useful option off the bench. Possible push to All-Rookie if he keeps this up?

Differing fortunes for the Nets' top 2 players to say the least so far this season"
716,Interesting Weird Stat: Trae Young has finally hits his first three against Steph Curry (when he's playing),"So Trae has hit a three against the Warriors but not yet when Curry has played. He as now 3 three's in the first quarter, and has matched Steph's point total, which is really crazy to believe. This is Traes 4th year into the league

&#x200B;

Edit: terrible grammar in title, live through it"
717,[Highlight] The Wolves get called for a 5 second violation in the clutch where only Russell moves to try and get the ball,
718,[Highlight] Ja splashes the three for the lead,
719,The Kemba for Horford swap so far is looking like a win for everyone involved,"Horford has been playing the best ball of his life on the Celtics so far this season. His advanced defensive stats are insane, averaging 13/9/3 and 2.6 BPG.

Kemba also seems to be doing well on the Knicks, for the $8m/year figure he's averaging 12ppg and shooting 48% from 3 to start the season."
720,Top NBA Finishers,"Top NBA Finishers Of All Time

Let’s take a look at the top NBA finishers from the past few decades. 

Karl Malone - The mail man always had to carry the load of the Jazz, but was never afraid to drop his package in a housewife during his SLC tenure. He finished in 3 women and fathered 7 kids.

Shawn Kemp - Phenomenal rim protector never tempted by the back door finish. However his box out game was weak and always finished a little to deep in her protected area. He finished in over 6 women fathering more than 7 kids. 

Dwight Howard - Basically the Citi Bike NBA center, everyone gets a ride. It’s no surprise he’s chasing a new mama in every NBA zip code. They say he’s got a D-12er, but hey…everything past 2 inches is just just guts anyway. He finished in 5 women fathering 5 kids. 

There’s your list of top NBA finishers. Instagram model role call, howdy hoooo!!!!!

721,DeMar Derozan goes for 28 pts 4 reb 3 ast 1 stl on 10/20 from the field 1/4 from 3 and 9/9 from the FT line,"DeRozan has been red hot to start the season. 

27/6/4 on 50/42/87 splits in 9 games. Will this be another all star season for the star SG? 

Lavine ends with 24/5/5/1/1 on 10/17 FG 

Bulls get a huge W against a hot Nets team

EDIT: DeMar went 7/9 from the charity stripe"

727,"Players with differences in FTA from last season to this Pt. 2: Dame (-3.8), Beal (-3.7), Harden (-2.5), Trae (-2.9)","I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qfqy48/players_with_largest_difference_in_free_throw/) when the season just got under way and given the small sample size I figured there would be some adjustment as players got used to the calls and got their legs under them. I took the same list of players but added a new column (% difference) which I think may reveal even more how some players have been affected and/or have been performing. I've also added the team average which also shows a drop.

Here are my takeaways:  

* In hard numbers Dame (-3.8), Beal (-3.7), Trae (-2.9) Harden (-2.5), Fox (-2.3) have seen the greatest reductions in their FTA
* But in % differences it's ever so slightly different Dame (-52.8%), Beal (-48.1%), Harden (-34.2%), Trae (-33.3%), Steph (-33.3%)
* In hard numbers Embiid might be up there at -2.1 but really in terms of %, he isn't at the same rate as those other guys, but still at -19.6% from last season
* Jokic definitely got out of that list: before he was at -4.0, now -0.5
* The guys that saw a big uptick before still remain at the top: Harrison Barnes (+2.9, +70.7%), Trezz (+2.4, +64.9%), and Brogdon (+2, +62.5%)

I'll be keeping an eye on this as the season progresses. [Here's my spreadsheet.](https://imgur.com/a/wWKZ5dP)"
728,Let's say LeBron continues to play in his 40s but as a role player and ...,"He joins teams that have a good chance of contending and wins an extra 3 rings. Does this boost his legacy? Like he's a journeyman at this point. 1 season he signs with the Warriors, wins it all as a role player, next season he signs with the Bucks, wins it all off the bench again and continues to do this until he retires. 

So he retires with 4 rings as the main guy and 3 rings as a role player. He's got 7 rings. Does this boost his legacy?"

733,[Clip Request] Blake Griffin getting slapped in the egg roll,"Sorry, but I laughed absolutely uncontrollably when I saw the slo-mo replay of this. Something about nut shots always get me lol. Any chance we can get this?"
734,"[Highlight] Fan throws a ball at Kemba Walker, interrupting play",
735,The Warriors have started running a play for GP2 they used to run for... Javale McGee.,"The play:

Payton comes upcourt for a screen. His defender leaves him to double Curry, who passes to the elbow, who lobs the ball up for Payton to dunk.

Because apparently we can play a 6'3"" guard at center on offense.

And it works."
736,Andre Drummond: first Sixer to haul in 25 rebounds since 1987,">Andre Drummond tonight in Philadelphia's loss against the New York Knickerbockers:

>14 PTS
>25 REB

>He is the first Sixer with 25+ rebounds in a game since Charles Barkley in 1987. 

Joel Embiid did not play and Drummond took over his role as center

738,What do Knicks fans think of Randle?,"I don't watch a lot of Knicks games, but saw him struggle in the playoffs last year and watched him tonight against the Sixers, and man. Does this guy realize he doesn't need to take a fadeaway midranger or a side step three on every possession. Like goddamn It felt like every shot he took was tough, and tonight he made a bunch... but doesn't surprise me at all he could go ice cold in a playoff series. Sixers had no one his size that could match up with him since they are so banged up and he didn't attack the basket or get to the line at all. So Knicks fans, can you win with him or would you flip him for some other B-level star?"

747,What are your favourite “what if”draft scenarios?,"It’s interesting with hindsight looking back at recent drafts and thinking what could have been.

Sorry Kings fans but I’ve always wondered what could have been if you drafted Lillard over Robinson. Lillard and a healthy Boogie could have made the West a whole lot more interesting those years GS and SA were dominating. Then theres the whole Luka situation…

I think another draft trade in 2013 between Utah and Minnesota (I believe it was Trey Burke for Muhammad) if that trade didn’t go down imagine the Jazz drafting Gobert and Giannis in the same draft.

They are just two that come to mind, what are yours?"

With no surprise, Big Z leads the way with 785 assists! Kevin Love is the only other player to break 500. Additionally, one assumption I made is that Markieff and Marcus Morris did NOT switch during any of their games.

Also, as a bonus, I calculated the most assists LeBron gave to an individual player in a single season. Here are the top 10 seasons:

&#x200B;

|Player|Season|Assists|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Anthony Davis|2019-20|184|
|Chris Bosh|2013-14|141|
|Kevin Love|2017-18|141|
|Drew Gooden|2004-05|134|
|Chris Bosh|2012-13|132|
|Mo Williams|2008-09|129|
|Dwyane Wade|2010-11|127|
|Kevin Love|2015-16|126|
|Kevin Love|2016-17|125|
|Carlos Boozer|2003-04|123|

As you can see, Anthony Davis blows everyone else out of the water in the 2019-20 season. I am also very surprised that Drew Gooden still has the 4th highest individual season for the 2004-05 season. While not in the top 10, Big Z still has 5 seasons of 100+ assists, the most 100+ assist seasons for any of LeBron's teammates.

And finally, as a second bonus, I also calculated the number of total assists LeBron James has to every draft class, as well as undrafted players! Here's the chart:

&#x200B;

|Rank|Draft Class|Assists|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|2003|1,520|
|2|2008|1,081|
|3|1996|1,072|
|4|2004|811|
|5|2011|634|
|6|2002|523|
|7|2012|349|
|8|2017|315|
|9|1998|296|
|10|2001|230|
|11|2013|219|
|12|2006|203|
|13|1995|196|
|14|1994|183|
|15|2005|154|
|16|2000|142|
|17|2007|116|
|18|1997|110|
|19|2015|102|
|20|1999|92|
|21|2010|87|
|22|2009|85|
|23|2016|71|
|24|2014|68|
|25|1992|59|
|26|1993|30|
|27|2019|24|
|28|2018|15|
|N/A|Undrafted Players|951|

His own draft class, mostly carried by Wade and Bosh (but with help from Mo Williams, Kyle Korver, and Sasha Pavlovic), has by far the most assists of any draft class. 

Anyway, those are the stats for all of LeBron James's assists. He still has a few years left playing and he should get to at least 10,000, so it will be interesting to see how these standings change. My guess is AD will pass Kuzma, Smith, Varejao, and Gooden. Wade, Bosh, and Love are questionable. No way anyone will ever pass Big Z though!

Hope you all enjoyed this!


Edit: HOLY SHIT I did not expect this to blow up. Thank you all for the support it means a lot!

Also, another person linked a website where you can find LeBron’s assist totals to every player each year so that could’ve saved me a lot of time lol. But, it was still fun to see the game by game progression as I was doing.

Finally, yes, it’s possible there was an error, but I mentioned in another comment the methods I took to make sure I was very careful. At most there might be a couple players off by 1 or 2, but nothing significant.

Edit 2: Forgot to add the 1998 draft class when creating the table. Fixed now."

751,[Wind] Michael Malone says Michael Porter Jr. is out of the lineup for the “foreseeable future.”,
752,Right now would you rather have John Wall or Russell Westbrook?,"These 2 have been around the block, we know their play styles. Neither can shoot very well, but Westbrook is at least more athletic than Wall at this point. Who you taking for your team?"
753,"Contrary to popular belief, KCP, Kuz, and Trez aren't overperforming and due for regression. They're performing exactly as expected. A quick look at how the Lakers acquisitions are doing:","Well, I'm not sure if it's popular belief. But I've definitely seen a lot of Lakers fans assuming that Washington is only off to a good start because the Lakers castoffs are playing better than usual with a chip on their shoulders. But looking at their stats, they're performing exactly as expected. Here's a quick rundown of their stats and some observations from a guy who's watched every minute of Wizards basketball this season.

---

**KCP in his last two seasons with the Lakers: 9.5/2.4/1.8 on 45/40/84 shooting, 0.9 TOV, 58.6 TS%**

**KCP this season: 9.3/4.1/1.6 on 43/40/67 shooting, 1.0 TOV, 54.9 TS%**

[Source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/caldwke01.html)

Overall KCP looks exactly like he did in LA: Slightly inconsistent 3&D but comes out to average a high percentage from three. Decent cutter. I've noticed he's putting the ball on the floor now in DC but I might not have been paying attention when he was in LA. He'll sometimes find guys for lobs or get himself a layup when he drives, other times he'll stop and pop in the midrange. He's getting 2 more MPG in DC.

---

**Kuzma in his last two seasons with the Lakers: 12.8/5.3/1.6 on 44/34/72 shooting, 1.6 TOV, 53.9 TS%**

**Kuzma this season: 14.1/9.5/2.1 on 42/35/48 shooting, 1.8 TOV, 50.7 TS%**

[Source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/kuzmaky01.html)

Kuzma has for sure been more impactful on the defensive glass, but that may partially be because he isn't playing with dominant rebounders like Lebron and AD. Washington didn't have a dominant rebounding big so he's filling that role. His offensive rebounding is actually down from last season. But overall he seems like the same Kuzma: very solid defense, inconsistent offense. He still has a tendency to force shots and make boneheaded plays, but looks excellent when cutting well and playing within Unseld's offense. He's been less efficient (leaguewide efficiency is down) and is really struggling from the line. He's also getting nearly 4 more MPG than last season.

---

Trez averaged 13.5/6.2/1.1 last season and is averaging 17.7/9.1/1.8 this season, but he's getting way more minutes this season now that he isn't playing behind Drummond and AD. Comparing his per 36 numbers, they look very similar. 

**Trez's Per 36 last season: 21.2/9.8/1.7 on 62/0/71 shooting, 1.7 TOV, 65 TS%**

**Trez's Per 36 this season: 21.2/10.9/2.2 on 64/20/82 shooting, 1.8 TOV, 70.3 TS%**

[Source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harremo01.html)

Trez has been the true surprise of the season. I'm not sure if his FT improvement is real and his efficiency will probably regress a little. But  his performance doesn't look like too much of an anomaly (unlike [another role player](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qni7zw/carmelo_anthony_is_currently_posting_an_effective/)). Trez is looking like he did two years ago when he won 6MOTY: muscling for offensive rebounds and great touch/offensive presence in the paint. Smart positioning to receive the ball and bully into his spots. He isn't a world beater on defense and guys are still shooting over him in the paint, which is why Gafford is so important as a rim protector and defensive anchor. But Trez has taken a bunch of crucial charges so far, which I appreciate. His interior passing is also way better than I expected. Trez is forming a nice two man game with Beal and has gotten good at finding Beal on cuts. I've seen him direct traffic from the high post like he's Jokic on some possessions. 

---


Overall, the Lakers acquisitions are doing almost exactly as expected. There's no anomalies in that trio who are gonna come crashing down to their mean. When you think about it, the Wizards being better makes perfect sense. Three role players performing to their contracts is more valuable than a single star who isn't performing to his contract. 

I'm not expecting the Wizards to stay a top 4 seed, but I am expecting them to be in the hunt for the 5-8 seeds along with Atlanta, NYK, Chicago, etc."

If it were him and Harden instead of Westbrook. Same with Lebron wasting 7 years in Cleveland with bad teammates. I understand why players want to leave bad situations as soon as possible.

I haven't watched a ton of Celtics basketball so I feel like there is something that I must be missing.

If they were to get Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield and picks for Simmons, they could easily win the title barring injury to Embiid.

Morey should focus on getting 2-3 quality role players that can play on both ends of the court or shoot 3s at high efficiency for Simmons rather than focus on another star that would require the Sixers to give up assets.

Rockets in 1994 and Mavericks 2011 both did this successfully. The Magic with Dwight Howard almost pulled it off as well.

With the league being smaller and more positionless, the Sixers could easily win with just being Embiid and friends rather than pairing him with another star like Lillard or etc.

791,[Ethan Fuller]: Hop on the Magic School Bus...Many people would be surprised to discover that the league leader in pull-up threes isn't Steph Curry or Kevin Durant...it's Orlando's Cole Anthony.,"When taking a look at Cole Anthony this season, it's easy to see just how much he's progressed from his rookie season; however, he's also giving Orlando something that they've been lacking since the Dwight Howard glory days...an elite deep-ball shooter.

Cole Anthony currently leads the league in pull-up threes, averaging almost 50% from that area (48.4% to be exact). Not only can the kid shoot from long range, but his hops have been nothing short of impressive as well. If Cole continues to shine with Fultz and Isaac returning soon, this Orlando team sure could shock the Eastern Conference in the next year or two.

It must feel great for Al, playing on this level at 42."
795,Which player do you believe would have been an NBA All Star more times in the other conference? Who would you replace in the ASG?,"For me it’s Jrue Holiday. 

He made one all star team in 2013 on the 76ers, then was immediately shipped to the Pelicans in the Western Conference, a move that helped Philly kick off The Process. 

Had he stayed in the East, I think he’s a pretty safe bet to make it in 2018 and 2019 (he made all-defensive honors already in those two seasons), easily replacing Goran Dragic and DeAngelo Russell, the injury replacements in the East in 2018 and 2019 respectively."

797,"What is better for an offense, a point guard who shoots 3’s at Westbrook’s efficiency and volume, or a point guard who does not shoot threes at all, like Simmons?","Both are phenomenal players overall and impact the game in other ways than shooting, but their biggest weakness is the same thing, on polar opposite ends of the spectrum. 

Westbrook shoots way more threes and shots overall, at high volume and low efficiency, whereas Ben probably doesn’t shoot enough, should be taking way more inside 10ft shots and open threes religiously. Both *can be* negatives to the offense sometimes, as defenders can sag off and help on others and it ruins spacing.

Just curious which you would all prefer, as there’s a chance Westbrook (and yes, possibly Simmons) helps lead their team to a championship this year, by contributing in every way BUT shooting, during an era when shooting efficiency is paramount."
798,stats.nba.com Import Help Google Sheets," I'm here wondering if anyone has found recent success importing a table from [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com/) to Google Sheets.

[NBA.com](https://nba.com/)'s stats site blocks usage of IMPORTHTML and IMPORTXML through dynamically generating their tables with Javascript. And I'm using the NBA's site because its the only free site that has the specific tracking data that I need.

I've [found an endpoint here](https://github.com/swar/nba_api/blob/master/docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/leaguedashoppptshot.md) that has the parameter I'm specifically looking for (""CloseDefDistRange""). But the URL always times out.

If it were possible to somehow get the data I need as JSON, that would be acceptable too because I copied the [ImportJSON](https://github.com/bradjasper/ImportJSON) Google script into my Sheet and can parse it on my own.

Essentially, if anyone knows of any way in 2021 to get a table from [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com/) imported to a Google Sheet, I would be extremely appreciative."
799,This season we could rename the Ewing Theory,"If you aren't familiar with the Ewing Theory, it states a team does better when a star player is removed from the team.

The name comes from Patrick Ewing, who's injury seemed to end the Knick's playoff run in 1999 when he tore his achilles in game 2 of the ECF. The Knicks went on to win the series and lose to the Spurs in the Finals.

There are many examples of the Ewing Theory, but I think if PHI wins the championship this year we should rename it to:

The Simmons Theory

1. Ewing's team found success without him, but a team winning the NBA championship hasn't happened yet.
2. There are other examples of this in other sports but Basketball stands above all others in the importance of a singular player, especially in 7 game playoff series.
3. The new name also gives a nod to Bill Simmons, who popularized the theory.

I am now a Philadelphia fan.

Jonas Valančiūnas, one of the 12 active players, is currently ranked #41 overall in WS/48.

> **Jaylen Brown in a Simmons trade is a non-starter**

> Multiple league sources were adamant to MassLive.com that the Celtics have no interest in moving the All-Star Brown in the interim, particularly with him under team control for two more seasons at a below-market deal. 76ers general manager Daryl Morey has always aimed high in trade negotiations throughout his career but this is posturing will likely go nowhere given what’s happened to Simmons’ trade value over the past several months in the midst of his holdout."

Pierce and Walker weren't enough to really make a team a contender. They each ended up winning a title, but on different teams and having vastly different roles (Pierce was the fMVP, Toine was a backup on the Heat).

I get the same feeling about Tatum and Brown, that together they aren't good enough to carry a team to a title. I like them individually better than I liked Toine and Pierce, but maybe they just don't fit together."

The Russell Westbrook trade is paying dividends for the Wiz as well. The newly acquired depth is helping so much, with KCP, Kuzma, and Harrell all having great seasons. Spencer Dinwiddie, who was also poached by Washington in the Westbrook trade, is having a good year, being a facilitator and regaining his form from his ACL injury last year.

830,NBA Week 3 Donuts,"Welcome to Donuts! This post will follow the longest streaks without recording each major stat.

**Field Goals:**

By Minutes: Killian Tillie (21 minutes)  
By Attempts: Killian Tillie (7 FGA)

Tillie hasn’t a huge amount of time to show out this season, and he has been moderately effective on the boards and at the point of attack, but my “shoot points” linear weights model has Tillie as the 7th-worst shooter in the league this season.

**3 Point Field Goals:**

By Minutes: Rudy Gobert (314 minutes)  
By Attempts: David Nwaba (7 attempts)

Gobert has attempted 7 3s in his career, and I think they are all heaves. That’s the only way he’s getting off the list unless he is injured. He has an enormous lead over #2 (Bam! Adebayo).

As a casual Bulls fan over my life, I had a little soft spot for Nwaba, who really improved in his one season in Chicago (he went from “not good enough to play in the league” from “a playable bench guy”) (The Hoiberg Bulls were so bad, Nwaba started 20 games that year). He’ll get off this list soon enough – he’s good for a dozen or more treys each season.

**Free Throws:**

By Minutes: Robert Covington (286 minutes)  
By Attempts: John Konchar, Day’Ron Sharpe (2 attempts)

Covington had 62 attempts at a free throw last year in 2,243 minutes. He had 124 attempts in 2,137 the year before. This is a pretty notable drought, I think. Second place in this stat is 85 minutes behind him.

**Missed Field Goals (min attempts 1):**

By Minutes: Jericho Sims (25 minutes)  
By Attempts: Sekou Doumbouya (4 attempts)

This is an extremely noisy stat. 4 attempts would be the record over the past 5 years or so, and I haven’t tracked it before that. This category is almost more fun just as a “who?se who” of the league.

Here is Jericho Sims’ only attempted field goal this season:

[https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?ContextMeasure=FGM&GameID=0022100018&PlayerID=1630579&Season=2021-22&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&TeamID=&flag=3&sct=plot&section=game](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?ContextMeasure=FGM&GameID=0022100018&PlayerID=1630579&Season=2021-22&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&TeamID=&flag=3&sct=plot&section=game)

**Missed Three Pointers (min attempts 1):**

By Minutes: Derrick Favors (141 minutes, 1 attempt)  
By Attempts: Dewayne Dedmon (2 attempts)

Favors attempts the overwhelming majority of his shots in the restricted area, as most bigs do. He does not set up for 3s. In the only years that cleaningtheglass has deemed his volume large enough for a percentile grade in 3s, he has graded out in the 7th and 8th percentiles.

A trio of bigs are on the top of this leaderboard (Favors, Dedmon, and Dwight Howard). This makes a ton of sense, as they are likely only ever attempting a 3 as a last resort or as a heave.

**Missed Free Throws (min attempts 1):**

By Minutes: Justin Holiday (321 minutes, 2 attempts)  
By Attempts: Jeremy Lamb (15 attempts)

Justin Holiday has never been a guy that gets to the line all that often. His only attempts this year have come from floor fouls, and only Covington is close to him in minutes played this year WITHOUT drawing a single shooting foul. I wouldn’t say it’s impossible to be a great offensive player without drawing a ton of fouls, but it certainly requires you to make a high percentage of your other shots, which Justin has not done this season.

Jeremy Lamb currently has the nifty honor of being in the 40/46/100 club. Lamb is 46.4% from deep and 33.3% from shallow.

**Offensive Rebounds:**

By Minutes: Marcus Smart (317 minutes)

Smart has had one of the largest declines in impact this season using my metrics (where he went from moderately above average to moderately below average). Still a capable on-ball defender, he’s regressed offensively in every metric – his usage is down (which theoretically means his shot selection should improve), but his points per attempt is the lowest of his career by a wide margin. Normally in the top ranks of assist%, he’s in the bottom half of the league in that stat and he’s in the bottom rung of turnover percentages as well. I’m not trying to bag on Marcus Smart here; let’s optimistically say that once he finally gets that first offensive rebound of the year, it’ll unleash the dog within and he’ll tear it up.

**Defensive Rebounds:**

By Minutes: Kelan Martin (35 minutes)

I’m a Kelan Martin fan, because he went to Butler. I have a soft spot of players that play for the NBA franchise closest to their alma mater. Martin doesn’t play enough to get a good grasp on his rebounding abilities, but he came down with his fair share of boards in the Big East, and that seems to have translated in his first two years in the Association.

**Assists:**

By Minutes: Semi Ojeleye (82 minutes)

Semi Ojeleye is quickly becoming the mascot of NBA Donuts. NBA reference lists the following as nicknames for him: Semi, Muscles Jesus, The Ox, Thor, The Ojeleye Factory, The Man Made of Granite. When you have 6 more nicks than assists, something is funny.

**Steals:**

By Minutes: Jeff Green (147 minutes)

Uncle Jeff has played on 12 different teams in his career. I love it. There’s no way this continues – Jeff isn’t a thief, but historically even the extremely low-volume stealers get about 1 every 100-120 minutes. Tacko Fall/Jabari Parker/Jalen Smith/Dakota Mathias all had 1 steal last year in the mid-100s minutes.

**Blocks:**

By Minutes: Harrison Barnes (372 minutes)

Harrison Barnes is in the running for most improved player this season – he’s been near All-Star-level this season. Just imagine when the Death Starnes is fully operational and he starts blocking a shot a game!

**Turnovers:**

By Minutes: Derrick Jones Jr. (77 minutes)

I’ve seen about half of all Bulls minutes this year. I freaking love Derrick Jones Jr. Interestingly, he’s second the donut list for assists, as well, and second on the list in missed free throws by attempts. I assume that Miami and Portland liked DJJ when he was there. Is this true?

**Personal Fouls:**

By Minutes: Danuel House (34 minutes)

The House party was closed this week.

**Club Trillion Leader:**

Joel Ayayi (4 minutes, no FGA/FTA/REB/AST/STL/BLK/TOV/PF)

What have we learned?

Absolutely nothing."

JRE = Jeremiah Robinson-Earl - one of the few 2021 2nd round picks who already started on an NBA game. He’s gotten Draymond/Batum comparison for his no-wrong move game

Then you have a star duo in SGA and KAT who I think fit each other well. They are surrounded by 3 and D wings but their bench is not that deep. NAW will sure provide the Clarkson type of offense for them.

I think it really depends on Shai and KAT but right now Shai is winning games singlehandedly while KAT is still having trouble grabbing wins despite producing great numbers every game"

835,Presenting... the NBA all Center team.,"In this post, I will construct a team that plays as close to a normally constructed roster as possible, with one catch...every player will be a center. 

1. Starting point Guard: Nikola Jokic

This one is easy. Jokic has the range and vision of a point guard already, averaging 26.4 points and 8.3 assists last year as an MVP. He shoots .39% from deep and is widely considered the leagues best passing center.


2. Starting Shooting Guard: KAT

There are a few names that might go here, but Shooting guard is a position for a score first, offensively minded player. As the only Center to hit 40% from 3, and a quick mover, KAT can provide spacing, and fight around screens up top to keep up with smaller guards he'd be lining up against. We want a knockdown shooter here, and Kat fits the Bill. 

Small forward: Bam Adebayo

This was a really tough call. The issue that has become apparent is that spacing will be a huge issue on this team, and so I needed to weigh the value of space vs pure talent. I also wanted someone able to keep up with the bigger, more explosive forwards in the league that might be able to put the ball on the floor and drive. Bam is switchable, Has a decent midrange game, and should be able to hold things down defensively. I also considered having Bam as our back up point guard, as he averaged 5.5 assists last season. But in the end it's hard to keep talent out of your starting line up.

Starting Power Forward: Joel Embiid

He has maybe the most complete offensive game of anybody in the league right now, even with a slow offensive start. He can place face up or back to the basket, has a good 3, and was the most efficient midrange shooter in the league last year. This is not the optimal place for him, as he might get blown by on the wings, but you have to keep the 5 open for-

Starting Center: Rudy Gobert

The most limited offensive game on this list is also the reason that our offense might not matter. The Stiffle Tower has a block% of 7, and holds opponents to a fraction of their typical shooting.  With him anchoring the D, there will be no easy paint points.


Bench: Myles Turner, Jonas Valanciunas, Deandre Ayton, Jusuf Nurkic, Brook Lopez

Thoughts? How would you set up a team like this?  How would you solve some of the more glaring issues like spacing and switch hunting offenses?"

853,[OC] Six Ownership Changes that would help the NBA,"We heard so much advanced media hype about these Robert Sarver allegations that I figured it would be scandalous, shocking, and feature Timothee Chalamet in some way.

Personally, I had a hard time mustering up much outrage over the specific allegations. Then again, I also grew up in L.A. at a time when proven racist Donald Sterling had free rein over an NBA franchise.

I'd be surprised if the NBA forces a sale of the Phoenix Suns in the same way they did for the Clippers, but this post raises the idea as a thought exercise. *What if the NBA could shift franchise owners more easily?* Who would stay? Who would go? What if owners had consequences for poor results in the same way that players, GMs, and coaches do? Here's how the changes may go down.

---

**MOVE ONE: Sorry, Sarver**

Again, I don't think these ESPN reports revealed anything criminal or devastating in Robert Sarver's behavior. Then again, I don't know anyone who would defend him as a good owner either. He's an odd duck, a sleazeball, and a penny pincher to boot. His sale of R1 picks cost the Steve Nash - era Suns, and his frugality may cost the Chris Paul - era Suns now.

Part of this stems from the fact that Sarver is -- by the standards of sports owners -- not exactly King Midas. According to public estimates, his net worth is roughly $400 million. That's obviously a loose and incomplete estimate because the franchise would be worth $1.5B in a sale, but I don't know his exact ownership share or his other business dealings. Still, we can safely say that Sarver is among the poorest NBA owners by a good margin; based on public estimates, he ranks 30th of 30 in that category. If we could wave a magic wand, we'd find a new owner for the **Phoenix Suns.**

In his place, let's give the team to a local billionaire -- Ernest Garcia III. The 38-year-old Garcia inherited a fortune from his father, but he's put that opportunity to good use. He graduated from Stanford, and founded a successful company in Carvana (the used car site.) Carvana is located in Arizona, and so is Garcia. In theory, a bright young owner like this would elevate the franchise.

---

**MOVE TWO: Yankee Swap**

Notably, Ernest Garcia III would differ from the rest of the lily white ownership ranks of the NBA. Even more notably, there's still only one Black owner (Michael Jordan) in a league where the majority of players are Black. I wouldn't call changing that a *mandate*, but it certainly wouldn't hurt.

If we look around the landscape of potential Black billionaires, a few candidates come to mind: business Robert Smith (net worth estimated at $5 billion), as well as celebrities like Oprah Winfrey ($3B), Kanye West ($2B), Rihanna ($1.5B) and Jay-Z ($1.5B).

But truthfully, the league doesn't need to look very far to find a viable owner: their own LeBron James. Right now, James' estimated net worth is around $800-900 million. That's not enough to put up a majority stake in an NBA team. That said, James still has time. We wouldn't want James to own a team *now*, so this would be more of a 5-year plan. James is going to be making $40M+ in the foreseeable future based on salary and endorsements, and his business dealings are doing well (his production company was recently valued at $750M.) I would imagine that LeBron James will be worth well over a billion dollars by the time he retires. And someone with James' profile could absolutely get loans or partners to cover whatever else is needed to buy and front an NBA team.

The perfect team: his old **Cleveland Cavaliers**. Obviously, that spot is taken right now by his old friend/nemesis Dan Gilbert. And health and saltiness concerns aside, Gilbert is a fine owner. He's exceptionally rich (net worth $30B) and puts money into the team. He doesn't deserve to have a team stripped away from him.

The solution? Yankee swap. We're going to move Gilbert off the Cavs, and give him the **Detroit Pistons** instead. Gilbert has some strong ties to the state of Michigan, which stands in contrast to the Pistons' current owner Tom Gores. Gores isn't the most popular owner anyway. I surveyed the reddit fan base about their local owner, and Gores only earned a score of 3.5 out of 10. 

That said, I don't want to strip away Gores' team based on a few reddit votes, so we're going to give him a sweet parting gift: a new expansion team in **Las Vegas**. (The Vegas franchise would probably be worth more than Detroit as a market, so Gores would have to make up the difference.) For all Gores' flaws, he may be well suited for a glamor market. He owns a private equity firm in Beverly Hills and his brother owns a Hollywood talent agency. He could fit the ritzy Vegas market well. 

---

**MOVE THREE: A Family Affair**

One of the most vilified and mocked owners in the NBA is the **New York Knicks**' James Dolan. Honestly, he probably gets more flak than he deserves because he's so easy to [goof on.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvGE2jXLBAo) He's not a BAD guy, and he's not the worst owner in the world. Still, he's not good enough to merit one of the most prestigious franchises in the NBA. 

If we could pick a dream replacement, we may as well swing big and bring in Amazon founder and cosmonaut Jeff Bezos. Whether you like Bezos as a person or not (guessing you do *not*), he offers obvious virtues as a potential owner. Primarily: the purse. He's not the richest man in the world anymore, but he's still worth a cool $195 billion. Better still, Bezos could find a way to put the Knicks front and center through Amazon's marketplace and streaming service and make them a national and global bedrock.

Ironically, Bezos' viability as an owner may *scare* the NBA. The other owners may think he'd corrupt the system and throw the balance of power out of whack. If push came to shove, Bezos could dive deep into the luxury tax and spend $250-300M a year on his payroll. The Knicks could have an unfair competitive advantage in that way. At the same time, that's not a bad thing from the perspective of the players. It'd add more money into the pot for them, and that luxury tax money would trickle down throughout the league.

If Jeff Bezos is going to strike fear into the hearts of the other NBA owners, then we need someone who is going to strike fear into *him.* And who is better to do that then... his ex-wife! That's right. MacKenzie Bezos is crashing through the door and becoming the owner of our 32nd NBA team, the re-born **Seattle SuperSonics.** I don't know if Mrs. Bezos has an interest in basketball, but she has the money ($50B estimate) to throw around anyway. 

Storylines and soap operas aside, there are at least 5+ billionaires who could represent the Seattle area and bring the Sonics back to life. From a league wide perspective, it'd be an added bonus if they could add a female owner, who could potentially add a female lead exec (like Seattle legend Sue Bird) to the party. This isn't a matter of social justice or being ""woke"" either -- it's also a cold, cynical way for the NBA to continue to drive growth. There's always going to be a physical barrier for women to compete in the NBA, and there may be some reluctance to embrace a female head coach as well. But there's absolutely no logical reason why a woman couldn't be just as effective in the front office or ownership group as a man. And if the NBA can promote more women to those leadership perches, its female viewership may increase as well.

---

**MOVE FOUR: Parting Shots and Warning Shots**

We focused on 6 franchises -- 2 of whom (expansion Las Vegas and Seattle) don't even exist. 

That said, there are a few other owners and ownership groups that would need to step up their game if they existed in a world with more culpability. I doubt the players would give a warm endorsement to the Orlando Magic's DeVos family (after their Trump ties) or to Houston's Tilman Feritta (after his general douchiness.)

In terms of staying competitive, other markets and owners have reason to worry. Kings' owner Vivek Ranadive hasn't done his small market many favors, creating some chaos with his erratic enthusiasm. Meanwhile, New Orleans is a mess all around. If they somehow manage to lose their second generational talent in Zion Williamson, the league will seriously need to think long and hard about the franchise's future in the Big Easy. For small market teams like them, front office and ownership competency becomes even more important. They haven't established the same basketball acumen that other small market teams like Oklahoma City or Memphis have enjoyed lately. We tend to think about NBA expansion as a thought exercise, but *relocation* may be a possibility as well. 

If I ran the league office, Seattle and Las Vegas would be the most obvious candidates for a new (or stolen) team. If the league wanted to balance the map, a Midwestern city like St. Louis or Kansas City could be viable. If they want to pick a desirable market for the players, then San Diego, Anaheim, or Austin could be an option. Some may bristle at the idea of *another* California or Texas team, but we have to remember those two states actually make up over 20% of the U.S. population (about 68M/330M).

In the long term, I imagine the NBA wants to spread its wings more internationally as well. A return to Vancouver is an easy one, logistically speaking. Going down to Mexico City is less so -- but it's possible if the league gets creative. Perhaps they can base a team's headquarters in San Diego and travel south for ""home"" games. Or theoretically, they can offer players' bonus pay (maybe +10 or +15%) if they play for a franchise based in Mexico or -- in the deep future -- in Europe.

In any event, the league should be prudent about expansion, relocation, and especially in regards to the new owners it selects for those teams. A few bad apples can ruin the bunch, and unfortunately they're not as easy to remove as social media or this post would suggest."

855,How High is Evan Mobley's ceiling?,"Evan Mobley is only 20 years old yet he has some of the best defensive instincts i've seen from a rookie big in a long time, he's leading the league in contested shots and has flashed serious playmaking and shooting potential already.

It's rare to see a big this impactful in his rookie season, the only bigs I remember who were similarly also impactful as rookies were AD, KAT, Embiid, and even Jokic.

How high is Mobley's ceiling on the Cavaliers?"
856,What is Zion’s peak?,"When Zion finally hits his prime how good will he be. Will he be an MVP calibre player or just a 
consistent all star."
857,Gary Payton II All-Defense Threshold,"So I'm a biased Warriors fan... Obviously... but i remember hearing Zach Lowe say ""if Payton got legitimate rotation minutes he'd be in the All Defense conversation... be regarded as one of the best on-ball defenders in the league"" 

I didn't believe it when I heard it... but rewatching all hus minutes this year (including summer and preseason) I'm thinking maybe Lowe's take wasn't all that off the mark.  What do you think?

What would it take (minutes/performance) for him to be considered.  1200 minutes?  Thybulle was a dominant defensive force and got there not getting starter minutes. I dunno just looking for honest non Warriors fan take on it."
858,How important is vertical in the grand scheme of things?,"During the NBA draft, the combine always measure how high one can jump but does it really matter?  Like a lot of superstars today like Curry, Jokic, Luka don't really jump that high but its their skills that make them the superstar they are."
859,"The Warriors are donating 100 meals to low-income families for every point scored, so far the Warriors have scored 1,025 pts which equals to 102,500 meals donated to Bay Area families","The Warriors partnered with local food banks to donate 100 meals for every point scored. This week the Warriors scored 360 pts which equals to 36,000 meals donated.

860,Sunday's Top 10 Plays,
861,"Who would you rather have, Deandre Ayton or Evan Mobley?","Ayton is 23 years old, 6'11"", 250lbs.

* 29.2 minutes
* 14.2 points (58.5 FG%, 25% 3PT%)
* 11.3 rebounds
* 1.2 assists
* 1.3 steals
* 0.7 blocks
* 20.6 PER

&#x200B;

Mobley is 20 years old, 6'11"", 215lbs.

* 34.4 minutes
* 14.9 points (52.0 FG%, 23.5% 3PT%)
* 8.0 rebounds
* 2.5 assists
* 1.0 steals
* 1.3 blocks
* 15.23 PER

Ayton is probably the better finisher, rebounder and defender while Mobley is the better ball handler and playmaker. Obviously Mobley is in his rookie season and is younger by 3 years. If you were to choose a player, would you take Mobley and let him develop into his potential or would you take Ayton? 

Don't consider contracts, simply the player today and what they can become. Ayton is obviously better right now but we don't know who will be better 3 years from now."
862,Cole Anthony 33 PTS/3 REBS/2 ASS/3 STLS/2 BLKS vs Utah,
863,If Evan Mobley keeps this up should he be DPOY?,"He is just insane defensively. Always on the right place, most contested shots in the league by far, 7ft tall and can guard 1-5. Most importantly Cavs are getting wins against good teams. Is there actually a better defender than Mobley in the league right now?"
864,Who have been the biggest surprises in the NBA this year?,"Besides rookies, I would say anfernee simons going from about the worst player in the NBA to a 6MOTY candidate.  I haven’t watched much besides the blazers this year, so who do you think the biggest surprises have been?

Not counting any of the rookies"
865,LaMelo Ball 21 pts 7 rebs 3 asts vs Clippers 21/22 season,
866,Would you rather have Dejounte Murray for De’Aaron Fox?,"For context,

Murray is averaging 18/8/8 with 2.1 steals and 0.4 blocks on 46/36/71 splits. He’s 25 years old.

Fox is averaging 18/4/7 with 1.2 steals and 0.2 blocks on 39/18/68 splits. He’s 23 years old.

Obviously Fox has been playing kind of bad this year, but he did just come off a 25 ppg season last year. But Dejounte is also a better defender. Who are you taking between the two?"
867,Tre Jones currently sits second in the league in Assist to Turnover Ratio at an impressive 9:1. In first place ... his brother Tyus with an INSANE 31:1 ratio.,"Be sure to entrust your jewelry with Jones & Co., because this family takes care of the rock.

868,[Highlight] Wizards with the great ball movement leading to the score,
869,We know about players like Pat Bev and Marcus Smart who you hate unless they play for your team. Who are some players who you love unless they're on your team?,"Pat Bev and Marcus Smart are archetypes of the pesky defender. They play with passion and often irritate opposing star players and opposing fans as a result. It's often said that you'll hate those guys, but if they play for your favorite team then you'll love them.

What about guys who are the exact opposite? Guys you love unless they're on your team?

I think Isaiah Thomas is a decent example. It seems everyone wants him to get a shot in the league, but not for their team. I don't think he's been loved by any of his team's fanbases since leaving Boston. Besides the Lakers I guess."
870,"[Golliver] After Hornets concede 22-0 fourth quarter run in loss to Clippers, LaMelo Ball: “I feel like I’ve got to be in there longer for the fourth quarter, you feel me? I feel like I came in a little late in the game.”",
871,"The Warriors: Best record, 1st in net rating, 1st in points, 1st in defense ,1st in threes ,1st in assists ,3rd in rebounds, 3rd in steals, 3rd in FG% ,2nd in 3P% ,2nd in FG% allowed ,3rd in 3P% allowed","The Warriors:

1st in net rating
1st in points

1st in threes
1st in assists
3rd in rebounds
3rd in steals
3rd in FG%
2nd in 3P%
2nd in FG% allowed
3rd in 3P% allowed

Klay and Wiseman are coming back soon plus they have assets for a big trade. Look out. https://twitter.com/statmuse/status/1457558769966014473?s=21"
872,What are some potential playoff matchups in the past decade that never happened but would have been interesting to see?,"Most of the time when this question is asked, it's either older answers like Jordan vs. Hakeem or obvious ones like LeBron vs. Kobe

What would you say would be some examples from recent years?"
873,[Highlight] Devin Vassell locking up Kenrich Williams and forcing a missed shot,
874,What were some teams of recent memory that players wanted to be traded to that didn't happen?,If I remember correctly Kawhi Leonard wanted to be traded to Lakers or Clippers but ended being traded to the Raptors. This could've led to Kawhi and LeBron being on the same team.
875,"If either Steph Curry or Kevin Durant wins MVP this season(which many predict one of them to do), they will either tie or break the record for the longest period between a player winning two MVP awards(6 years, set by Wilt Chamberlain from 59/60 to 65/66)","Steph would tie the record, with 6 years between 15/16 and 21/22

KD would break it, with 8 years between 13/14"
876,"[Highlight] Jordan ""JPL"" Poole dropped 25pt on the Rockets in victory. His 3rd game in a row as GSW leading scorer.",
877,[Highlight] Hornets vs Clippers Full Game Highlights,
878,The Clippers have won their last 12 games at home against the Hornets/Bobcats with a 120-106 W tonight,"The last time Charlotte earned a win at Staples Center vs the Clippers was on February 28, 2009 (a 100-95 W)."
879,Why don't Raptors run Anunoby at Shooting Guard?,"Considering they already fulled their Small forward and Power Forward with Siakam/Barnes, wouldn't it be wise to run Anunoby at Shooting Guard? He's not a shot creator or primary ball handler in comparison to Siakam/Barnes. 

I'm sure this was why they lost to the Nets today."

882,[Highlight] Rockets vs Warriors Full Game Highlights,
883,The Warriors can run an all-2nd-gen-NBA-star lineup*,"With Gary Payton II now playing for Golden State, four members on GSW's roster have fathers who also played for the NBA: Steph Curry (Dell Curry), Klay Thompson (Mychal Thompson), and Andrew Wiggins (Mitchell Wiggins).

Add in Damion Lee, who became Dell Curry's son-in-law after marrying her daughter in 2018, and the Warriors can field a lineup entirely composed of second-generation NBA players. (Yes, I realize including a son-in-law is kind of a stretch, hence the asterisk in the title.)

Has there been a team capable of doing this before? And just how badly would a Curry/Thompson/Wiggins/Payton/Lee lineup dad-dick their own fathers?"
884,[Highlight] Terance Mann attacks the paint and elevates for a Mann's jam,
885,Jordan Poole 25 points,Shoots a efficient 7/13 from the field. And went 9/9 from the free throw line in response to iggy. Up to 47% from the field after a slow start.
886,The Nets 7-3 record games is their best 10 game start since their move to Brooklyn.,"The nets moved to Brooklyn in 2012. Their records since then through 10 games have been:

2012-13: 6-4 (First Joe Johnson year, team was pretty good.)

2013-14: 3-7 (First year after the infamous Paul Pierce and KG trade, team was hilariously garbage until New Years when they went on a run.)

2014-15: 4-6 (Weird team with ISO Joe, Brook, Thad Young, D will, etc that honestly should’ve been better than 38-44.)

2015-16: 1-9 (Awful 21 win team.)

2016-17: 4-6 (Ended up being even worse with 20 wins. Team was actually decent when Lin was healthy but in the middle of the year when he was out they played unimaginably awful. THEY WON ONE GAME IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY COMBINED... (Sorry NOLA))

2017-18: 4-6 (Team was a little better thanks to dinwiddie.)

2018-19: 4-6 (This team brings back great memories.)

2019-20: 4-6 (Team struggled to mesh with Kyrie. Honestly just a very forgettable year overall.

2020-21: 5-5 (Tough start with Kyrie and KD dealing with injuries before the harden trade.)"
887,"If you could change the outcome of only one Finals series that your favorite team lost in their history, which one would it be?","I'm torn between 1969 and 2008.

If the Lakers won in 1969, their Big 3 of Wilt, West, and Baylor would have gotten at least 1 together. 1972 was no doubt special but Baylor retired at the beginning of that season.

If the Lakers won in 2008, Kobe's legacy would have gotten a major boost if he three-peated without Shaq. Not to mention how great it would have been if he won it his MVP year."
888,[Highlight] Miles Bridges punches it home off the lob from Rozier to start the 4th quarter with a bang,
889,[Highlight] Serge Ibaka turns back the clock and rejects Cody Martin's poster attempt (foul overturned),
890,"Curry in 3 quarters: 20 pts, 8-16FG, 4-11 3 PT, 3 STLs, 0 TURNOVERS!","Great overall game from Steph. He sat the 4th quarter with the score 83-103. Obviously, his 3pt shot is still not looking great for his standard shooting 36% tonight. He had 0 turnovers but only 2 assists. Great to see the squad doing well despite steph sitting a whole quarter. Reminiscent of the strength with numbers years. Also, with 3 steals, steph's DPOY campaign is still ON /s.

891,Who has physically grown the most while in the NBA?,"We always hear crazy stories about NBA players hitting crazy growth spurts while in high school (AD, Rodman, etc). Are there any guys that have significantly grown after they got drafted?"

We are still missing Jonathan Isaac and Markelle Fultz who will likely start for the team once they are back at 100%."
894,Under appreciated players,"Obviously Ricky Rubio just balled out but I’d like to hear who are the some of your most under appreciated players.
Jonas Valanciunas is putting up some solid stats, I’ve always liked him since 2k17 in mycareer and I stand by that he’s one of most reliable players and works well with any star.
He’s just come off 20p 15r 4a against GSW"
895,So who exactly is going to lose minutes for Klay to come back?,"Sure they have played some lesser teams, but man there are periods when GS are just playing such great basketball and Steph doesn’t even need to be on the floor"
896,Who should I read instead of Zach Lowe?,"I absolutely love his work, especially 10 things, but with the ESPN+ paywall I no longer have access (I’m behind on making this post, obviously).  Can you all recommend any writers that might fill that void?"
897,[Highlight] Gary Payton II finishes the designed alley oop play,
898,"Going into today's game, the Nets had a negative net rating in 234 minutes with both KD and Harden on, but a hugely positive one with only one of them. As KD and Harden develop better chemistry, this will be very scary for the rest of the league to say the least","Source: [https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612751&Season=2021-22&SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&PlayerIds=201142,201935](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612751&Season=2021-22&SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&PlayerIds=201142,201935)

Going into today's game:

Both on: -2.61

Both off: -32.43

Only KD: +26.4

Only Harden: +14.04"
899,Harden closes the curtains on the Raptors with 15 pts in the last 5 minutes of the 4th including the dagger 3,
900,[Highlight] Jalen Green gets the transition dunk!,
901,[Highlight] Terance Mann beats the buzzer with a long three,
902,Do players shoot free throws better or worse after timeouts?,"Is there any perfentage difference on free throws if there is a timeout called in the time after they are fouled and before they shoot? Im just curious becuase if im a coach and i know players shoot better after a timeout, i might call a timeout before my player steps up to the line. If i know players shoot worse and my player fouls the opposing team, i might call a timeout before they shoot"
903,[Highlight] Ivica Zubac dunks right over the top of Miles Bridges,
904,Should the Lakers trade for Mike Muscala?,"One of the main issues for the Lakers so far is their lack of shooting. Another one of their big problems is that they give DeAndre Jordan too many minutes at the Center position. Muscala would fit in well in the Lakers bench unit by being a big who can shoot the three. This would benefit both Lebron and Westbrook while Muscala would also be more playable when sharing the floor with AD. While his defense isn't great, he does have his moments and can go on a streak of blocking shots. Finally, he isn't being paid that much money, meaning that matching salaries wouldn't be difficult. 

So should the Lakers trade for Muscala and bring him back?"
905,[Highlight] Spurs vs Thunder Full Game Highlights,
906,"In all their 3 wins this season, the Oklahoma City Thunder have overcame 16+ point deficits","In all their 3 wins this season, the Oklahoma City Thunder have overcame 16+ point deficits

vs Spurs : overcame 45-29 deficit in 2nd quarter"
907,What happened to Allen Crabbe?,"Allen Crabbe is only 29, is a good shooter, good off the ball, and has good length for a wing. Also a high character guy. How is he not on a roster?"
908,[Highlight] Otto Porter Jnr hits his three straight three-pointers within 40 seconds and Chase Center erupts!,
909,[Highlight] KJ Martin flies through the air for the putback!,
910,What teams do you fear or hate when your team plays against them?,"Could be a squad that always seems to have your team’s number, is a bad matchup or just always puts up a tough fight regardless of the outcome."
911,Why isnt Suggs closing for Orlando,"This is their number 5 pick, but he's not closing games and its not like they got super stars ahead of him, I mean Gary Harris and RJ Hampton??? Like who??? Hes a super talented player, shouldn't be wasting away on the bench during crunch time"
912,What kind of contract would Gordon Hayward get if he became a free agent right now?,"I would say he would get around 3 years / 45 mil, and that's based on the hope that he improves closer to how good he used to be."

914,[Highlight] Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Half Court Lob to Jeremiah Robinson-Earl,
915,Wendell Carter Jr had 22p 15r 6a on 9/14 from field and 4/7 from 3 with a team high +19 in a win against reigning DPOY Rudy Gobert's Utah Jazz,"Incredible game from WCJ, and it's becoming a regular occurrence. He impacts the game in so many ways and has been one of the most consistent players on the Magic. 

WCJ has been the perfect modern big for us. Starting at PF, he has show the ability to guard 5s inside, guard 4s on the perimeter, shoot the ball efficiently (39.5% from 3 on the year) and is an excellent passer.

Locking him up for a frontloaded 4y/50m contract looks like it's gonna be a steal for Orlando. He's only 22!"
916,The Slim Reaper & The Beard catch fire in Toronto for 59 points in victory,
917,Why is Curry the only one who gets credited for 'gravity',"You'll see people on here after Curry has a bad shooting night say he still had an above average game due to his gravity giving his teammates wide open shots, which is not something I'm denying but the same can be said for most of the best players.

Giannnis driving into the paint causes as much disruption to defenses as Curry moving off ball, that's why the Bucks are able to have shooters at the corners an have Giannis just pass it out to them

KD standing inside the arc on a mismatch is able to cause double and triple teams and leaves teammates wide open.

Harden when he was in Houston created so much disruption that he'd be trapped before even crossing the half court

But when these players have bad shooting games no one says they still had good games because of their gravity created open shots, why is this only said for Curry???

I'm not a Curry hater, I think he's the third best player in the league right now."
918,Jalen Green really be wearing short shorts,It just stands out. His teammates wear longer ones in comparison. Do players get to choose shorts length? How short can we get? Which player do you think can push the limit of short length?

I would only count the Pistons and Rockets as fully healthy “easy win teams”, which are teams that other teams will expect a win from 90% of the time. Pelicans without Zion would also be considered one of those. Is this usually the case?"

Ricky Rubio tonight: 37 PTS (career-high), 10 AST, 8-9 3P (career-high). He is the first player in NBA history with 30+ points, 10+ assists, 8+ threes in a game off the bench."
926,What's going on with De'Aaron Fox? His numbers are down across the board,"Currently his true shooting is at 46%. His PER100 point production is lower even than his sophomore year and almost on par with his rookie year. He's shooting 18% from downtown on 5 attempts. Even if this is a short slump, it's fallen off a cliff.

927,Ricky Rubio is currently shooting a better percentage from 3 (42.9%) than Stephen Curry is from the field (41.1%),"After an incredible performance tonight where he hit 8 long range shots out of 9 attempts, Ricky Rubio is sitting at 24/56 from three point range.  
  
In comparison, Stephen Curry is just 41.1% from the field at 37.5% from three. I think after all these years we can finally agree that Rubio deserved to be drafted ahead of Curry.

931,"Bradley Beal in a win vs the Bucks: 30 points on 14/22 FG, 2/3 3PT along with 8 assists and 5 rebounds","Bradley Beal was in control nearly all game. He picked his spots, scored efficiently, and got his teammates involved when he needed to. He also played some solid defense and got a crucial clutch steal to make up for throwing it away the possession before. Needs to work on his clutch ball handling though. 

Wizards are looking solid to start the season and move to 7-3 with the win over the defending champs."

935,"Before sending in the bench, Cavs go 13/17 from 3 in the second half of their win against the Knicks. They are a bottom 5 3PT shooting team (3P/3PA/3P%). Rubio shoots 8/9 from 3, 37 points. Mobley adds 26 points and 9 rebounds","Career game for Rubio and Mobley, albeit a young career for Mobley.

Rubio: 37/3/10, 8/9 from 3

Mobley: 26/9/5/1/1, 11/15 from the floor

Allen: 18/17, 8/15 from the floor

Some pretty special performances in the 17 point win and second half demolition of the knicks. Cavs shot 13/17 from 3 in the second half, which is pretty incredible considering cavs are 27th in 3P made, 26th in 3P attempted, and 25 in 3P%. They are also down 3 of their, theoretically, best 3PT shooters in Love and Lauri, and Sexton (who went down in the 1st half with a knee injury). I am sure this has nothing to do with the knicks defense being 28th, 29th, 19th in 3PA, 3PM, and 3P%."
936,Who is your surprise team so far this season?,Ive been really impressed with the cavs this season so far. Last season they started 3-0 and tbh i was hyped but this feels different . This feels like a team that can keep around a .500 record and can make the play-in tournament which is honestly a good achievement for this young team considering there are so many good teams in the east this year

951,NBA Arena that are hard to look at…,"Is there a team/s arena that you do not like at all? Where you don’t like the design or features and colors? I personally cannot stand the Pelicans arena, everything seems dimmed, I don’t like the color combination, I dread having to watch the sixers play in NO because of this, crazy I know."
952,[Ira Winderman]Udonis Haslem reflects on goal of Miami Heat ownership stake,
953,[Highlight] Gobert shows off his handles and mid-range jumper,
954,Which current NBA player has finessed their team/the league the most?,"By finessed I mean being able to trick people about their actual value to the league somehow and thus being heavily desired by contenders and/or getting lucrative contracts.

Here would be my top picks:

**Russel Westbrook**

Has almost never played any kind of winning basketball and obviously only plays for stats. He's given up wide open shots or assists to try to secure a triple double with a forced assist/shot. He's stolen countless rebounds from teammates even at the cost of being out of position for defense among a million other flaws. But he fills up the stat sheet so GMs, coaches, players and owners think he's extremely valuable. In other words, Lebron thinks he's really valuable. Which means he has it made no matter how he performs. It's actually quite impressive.

**Ben Simmons**

Shouldn't have to explain this one. But in case you've been living under the rock, the Sixers gave Simmons an albatross contract hoping he'd use it as motivation to improve his shooting and he's only gotten worse every year. The Sixers are also off to a better regular season start than several years past with Ben not playing so that also shows how awful his contract is.

**Blake Griffin**

Blake pretended he was completely washed during his last few months in Detroit. He wouldn't even dunk despite that being the main reason he became famous. Then Detroit gave in and bought him out, letting him go play for a contender thinking he had little value left. During his first possession in the first game with the Nets, he went for a monster jam. And since then, he's given the Nets valuable minutes.

So which current player do you think has finessed the league the most?"
955,What are the chances of Nets-Bucks first round series?,"With the Nets getting hot and the Bucks slumping, two championship contenders are going two separate ways in the rankings.

The Bucks have multiple key players out for an extended period of time whereas the Nets, besides Kyrie, are fully healthy and looking to take the top of the East. These two teams obviously had the best series of the playoffs last year and now both are the opposite ends of the spectrum.

If the Bucks make the playoffs, what are the chances that they'll rematch with the Nets in the first round? Could it be a 3 vs 6 matchup? A 2 vs 7 or 1 vs 8 via play-in?"

957,"[Haynes] After several practice facility staffers were interviewed about Neil Olshey’s hostile workplace conduct, the investigation is now being extended and expanded to include current and former Portland Trail Blazers employees, league sources tell @YahooSports.",
958,[Highlight] Buddy Hield with the buzzer beater to end the first quarter!,
959,Could a defender who knows he's not going to make the close-out clap their hands really loud to startle the shooter?,"So this goes off one my pick-up tactics that I'd say helped me in my defense. If I was ever late on a rotation or closeout, I would just clap my hands really loud to startle the shooter. The gesture of a sort of slap close to the shooter along with the ear-drum rattling clap were pretty effective."

> 
> Kevin Durant, who took a charge, says he's ""a part of the crew"" with the Blue Collar Boys. We'll see if Blake and Joe approve his application.

>Blake Griffin on Kevin Durant's admission to Blue Collar Boys: ""I don't know if he knows the application process takes a while. While we do like him as a prospect, it's gonna be a bit of a go. He's gonna have to jump through a few hoops. There's no easy way into the Blue Collar Boys."""
962,Iv seen a few articles about a few stars not liking the new ball I'm wonder do yal think that could messing with Westbrook a bit also? He hasn't said anything but.,As I'm watching him play man old boy is not looking good at all his shots not even close missing by miles. His turnovers are crazy anyway What do you y'all think?
963,"Kevin Durant in his return to Toronto: 31 points on 11-18 shooting, 7 boards and 7 assists.","His only flaw tonight was an ugly 7 turnovers. Still, to look at what the mood was last time he was on this floor in front of these fans, questions about whether we’d seen the last of one of the all time greats at his best, and to now see him putting up an MVP year, you’ve gotta love it as a fan of basketball."
964,Top 3 rookies so far: 1. Evan Mobley 2. Scottie Barnes 3. Josh Giddey,"as much as i enjoy the rabid raptor fans, hyping up their guy, the eye test is leaning towards Mobley. Scottie is clearly going to be amazing, altho i wonder how Siakam coming back will affect his minutes, and overall production. currently he averages more minutes than any rookie, which obvious helps the numbers:  
  
https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=MIN&dir=-1&Season=2021-22&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&PlayerExperience=Rookie  
  
  
Duarte has been great, but Giddey is impressive AF. dude is dribbling the ball up, setting up his teammates, and some solid gritty plays on both ends of the floor.  
  
still have a lot of faith in Cade, think he's gonna finish strong, and might even get ROY. haven't given up on him yet."

969,How good would the Pelicans front court be if they kept AD/Cousins,"Make Zion play the 3, AD the 4, and Cousins the 5. Re-sign Rondo and Jrue Holiday and that’s a solid contender right there. The Lakers seem more of a dumpster fire than NOLA, with their only problem being that Zion loves shrimp po boy too much"
970,[Highlight] Harden doesn't receive a call after Gary Trent Jr. fouls him,
971,Harden and Durant combine for 59 pts 18 reb 15 ast to lead the Nets to their first W in Canada since 2015,"Harden came alive. His 3 ball wasn't working until he drained the first one with 4 min left in the game.

Blake also hit 5 threes for one of his best shooting nights so far.

KD doing KD things as usual.

Nets looking spooky without Irving early this season!"
972,"James Harden this afternoon vs the Raptors: 28 points on 10/20 FG, 5/6 FT, 3/10 3PT along with 10 rebounds and 8 assists","+11 in the game, and only 2 TOV as well.

Harden still doesn't look like he's fully healthy but he looked much better today. He was able to get into the paint against a pesky Toronto defense. He was short on a few of his floaters but he was often able to follow them for the putback layup. Once his three pointer started falling late, it was curtains for the Raps."
973,Can someone explain this rule to me?,"So I’ve been watching basketball since when Toronto made the playoffs with Kawhi, partly because I always liked Kawhi and also to support Toronto as a Canadian.

Anyways, the one thing I’ve never understood is how a shooting foul can be called when the contact occurs way after the ball has left the shooters hands. I usually see this happen with 3s. Someone will be wide open and take a three, the defender will sprint and jump to try and block it. At that point the ball has already left the shooters hands, he has no more control over the trajectory of the ball, and when the defender grazes his elbow or something, they’ll call the foul. It just makes no sense to me."
974,"[Discussion] Until last year a lot of people assumed that Tyronn Lue was a bad coach and a puppet for Lebron, After last season however, he is universally acknowledged as one of the best tacticians in the league. Are we making the same error with Jason Kidd? Has he improved a huge amount since 2018?","I was one of those fans who thought that Ty Lue was just a puppet acting upon Le Coach when hes a brilliant tactician in his own right. Now many are clowning Kidd for his bucks tenure when it looks like hes improved vastly since then. As a player he had one of the highest bball IQ of all time, and it seems like he is a much better coach than when he was fired from Milwaukee. What do y'all think?"
975,Keeping track of the Lakers record without LeBron (1-3),"The theme of their offseason was keeping the team afloat while LeBron load-manages. Westbrook is apparently the guy to make that happen. They gave up the majority of their depth in KCP, Kuzma and most importantly, Caruso who was a casualty of the massive contract Westbrook required. Additionally they gave up on re-signing Harrell and Schroder. The Lakers apparently also had a deal on the table to trade Kuzma, Harrell and their 2020 1st rounder for Buddy Hield, but that deal was tossed over the Westbrook trade. Trading for Hield would have allowed the Lakers to keep KCP and Caruso with significantly less tax burdens. They could have featured a lineup of:

Caruso/Hield/KCP/Lebron/AD

Now, 10 games into the season we are starting to see the results of their experiment. The contentious argument is the Lakers were unable to win games last season without Lebron. In actuality, they went 12-15 without their star player, a .44% win-rate. While not a playoff-level team, they still outperform this year's team who have a .25% win-rate. With last year's 72 game season, the Lakers went 30-15 with LeBron for a .66% rate. If we can assume they will have the same win rate with LeBron this season and he misses 27 games, they would win 36 of the 55 games LeBron would play. Of the missing 27 games and a 0.25% win-rate, we could expect the Lakers to win 7 of those games with a Westbrook-led team. Thus giving them a total of 43 wins, only 1 more than they had last season while playing 10 more games. At 43 wins they have .524% total win-rate, which in 2020 would have made them ineligible to make the play-in where the lowest winning team, the Grizzlies had a .528% win-rate. If their current woes without Lebron persist, this pace suggests that a Lakers team led by Westbrook is in-fact not better than last year's team where they retained their role-players.

Without Lebron the Lakers have recorded the following game log:

Wins:

SAS (10/26)

Losses:

OKC (10/27)

OKC (11/4)

POR (11/6)"
976,New Rule changes seem to advantage certain teams,"This season teams with a 'physical' reputation (ex. TOR, NYK, MIL) seem to get away with far more contact than other teams. Overall i'm a fan of most of the rule changes, refs just seem to be a biased as to what teams/players they apply to."
977,(Clip request) Harden gets hugged by Trent Jr trying to intentionally foul. Harden does not get the call,I know we used to hate the man but It is absolutely ridiculous this season. This game only he has been fouled plenty of times without a call. Happened after the midway of the third quarter
978,Why has Anthony Davis declined so hard since the Lakers championship?,"Anthony Davis statistically has been a shell of his dominant self ever since the end of the bubble 


**AD last 3 season with Pels**: 27.5ppg/11.6rpg/2.4bpg on 59.6% TS (206 games)

**AD first season with Lakers**: 26.1ppg/9.3rpg/2.3bpg on 61% TS (62 games) 


**AD since the bubble**: 22.1ppg/8.6rpg/1.7bpg on 55.4% TS (46 games) 




I heard a lot of people excuse last season as him just playing injured, but he came into this season healthy and his stats and efficiency are still down across the board from his Pels days and championship run




What happened to this dude?

983,[Highlight] Fred VanVleet absolutely dismantles the Nets defense with a double-hesitation dribble play to get an open lane to the rim,
984,"The 3rd seeded Dallas Mavericks would be the ... um, 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference","And in terms of games behind, they would be tied for the 3rd spot. Is the East still the better conference this year? Or should we maybe wait until, say, 15 games have been played?"
985,[Highlight] Scottie Barnes just rips the ball away from Kevin Durant before taking it to the other end for an easy reverse slam,
986,The Raptors are very fun to watch,"Have to be honest I was sleeping hard on them. Not only do they look like a legit playoff team but the way they play is wildly entertaining, everyone's playing hard, hustling on D, and my god they are TALL. Now with Siakam back and an exciting new rookie, this team can do some damage in the East.

What do you think is their ceiling this year?"
987,Anyone here supporting 2 NBA teams?,Just curious 🧐. I’m a Cavs and Lakers fan (liked them in Kobe/Shaq days). But I also have players I like within the league that I follow.
988,[Highlight] Scottie Barnes dances around Kevin Durant for a clean layup and then hits James Harden with a spinning mid-range fadeaway on back-to-back possessions,

1,Can I start basketball at 13 years old I’m in 8th grade,I’m a 5’10 girl who’s been always told I should play basketball. I’ve always shown interest in basketball but I couldn’t join any basketball teams in Elementary school due to parents work schedule or had much time to ever go shoot some hoops bc my apartment and parks around us didn’t have a basketball hoop. I’m asking this because it seems like many basketball players start as young as they’re in elementary school and my age is like the age that they’re pretty much experienced.
2,Who do you believe will win Most Improved Player?,
3,"I’ve never played basketball before, Is it too late to start?","As you can obviously see in the title i’ve never played basketball before and i want to start playing it mainly because 1. I think it’ll be interesting to play a different sport 2. I don’t wanna be bored considering football season has already ended.

I am an 8th grader thats 205 pounds ( Yes i know that isn’t good for a 8th grader i am working on it) and i have literally no basketball experience whatsoever ( I haven’t even touched one before) is there any way i could start and if there is how would i start playing basketball?"
4,Rock Bottom,"I have hit rock bottom. I’m in my first year of High school, Everything has gone wrong. I used to be at the top, used to be the best basketball player in my city, had the girl I wanted for so long, had so many great friends. Then in this past year I lost all of it, the girl I was once with  and all her friends treat me like a absolute loser, and all my friends who used to always call me and wanted to hang out never want to anymore. No one messages me, no one takes me serious anymore. I am still good at basketball but I’ve definitely lost a step, lost motivation, lost my cardio, lost that drive, I feel like a total loser. I can feel a fire burning deep inside me I just need help getting it out. I used to be a very very hard worker and a I know it’s still inside me. Any advice guys? I would really appreciate it. I will update this every time something major happens. 
Thanks everyone."

I can’t shoot AT ALL, I’ve tried so hard to fix my jumper but the ball just won’t go through the hoop. I just can’t do it.

Should I just give up? Whenever I play against my friends, I always win and I score most of the points. But my only baskets are shitty contested layups and lucky three pointers. I get clamped so hard and just hit shitty shots sometimes."

I was focusing on rebounds and boxing out other post players but even that didn't make a significant difference, when it comes to actual skills my layups are probably most decent I'm working on shoot form outside of practices, my question would be, what even the player with my skill and experience can do/ should focus on to contribute to the team? as I will be playing every 2 weeks at least I want to help the team and not feel useless."

ive also changed my shot to be more one motion and all these people and videos tell me to release the ball just above the forehead in order for range (which i struggle with) and speed, but when i do this my follow through is practically straight in front of me and not higher in the air.

I've been the point guard since I was 12 until 22, I stopped playing basketball completely. But recently I'm just back to the ball game after 10 years. I joined a weekly pick-up game and found out myself losing so many skills in shooting and fitness isn't as good as before. 2 skills I'm still having is passing and dribbling but they're less bad.

I started to go to a court near me to practice one hand form shooting for 2 weeks now and I recorded myself shooting in the slow motion. Also, I've been practicing ball dribbling using CP3's content. 100 shots per day, now I've done for 2 weeks. it's still quite far away yet as I played pick-up game yesterday. 

Basketball IQ

I watched the recording of the pick-up games. mostly I pass the court and give anyone who shout at me... I don't have any strategy and sometimes I lack of leadership in making decisions. Simply, I have no scoring methods/systems.  I used to be faster and get into the filed, laying up and shooting. Now I'm not young anymore.... Need to change methods.

I'd like to set up something like a training plan that I can know how progress I have; Just for tracking. But i never make one so I'd like to see some formats or templates.

Nevertheless, it's Nike thing, just do it."

73,How to play point guard & run the offense in pickup & rec?,"How to play point guard & run the offense in pickup & rec league?

I’ve been playing pickup for over 10yrs. Recently I’ve been trying to run point for this group of older guys I play with. Unfortunately, whenever I bring the ball up, I get pressed or doubled into a turnover. Same thing happens when I play point for my rec league. 

I work on my handles a lot but I notice the people who are usually bringing the ball up without giving it up usually don’t have the greatest handles. How do I get better at this?

When I play with the group of guys my age, i usually bring the ball up exclusively no problem but they don’t press as much. I’d like to develop my IQ in terms of what to look for as a point guard. 

Since there’s no plays we run, should I just look for the first open man? When do I hold the ball for longer as opposed to giving it up quicker? When do I run pick & roll? When do I give up the rock for someone else to bring it up? Should I look for mismatches in terms of size & speed?

I’ve always watched Rondo, Cp3, Lebron, Stockton. I love the way they play the game and I always wanted to play more like them. Problem is, it’s hard to know what they’re thinking even watching film on them. Recently, in the games I’ve played point, I enjoyed it so much more than the games where I’ve scored majority of the points."
74,"Can Somebody Clearly Define What a Carry is and for the ""ball to be at rest""?"," So I was talking with a guy about the carrying rule and He had mentioned that a carry was not only dipping your hand past the equator (top half, top hemisphere, etc.) of the ball, but also stopping the momentum of the ball. In all my years of playing basketball i had never heard of this. So I looked up the rules and here you find the phrase [""ball comes to rest"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_(basketball))

 I always viewed this phrase to mean discontinue a dribble because in the gather rule it uses the [same phrasing.](https://official.nba.com/new-language-in-nba-rule-book-regarding-traveling-violations/) Even though the ball still has momentum since it may be moving with the player in a layup or dunk, the ball is at rest here. Also, wouldn't a simple dribble like the crossover be impossible if carrying was stopping the ball's momentum? You have to do this in order to change hands.

 Can any experienced players or refs preferably give input?"

He doesn’t discipline anyone, claims he used to do film for the Suns and Jazz but doesn’t know any plays or offenses, and overall he’s not very respected.

For now I want to improve my fitness so that basketball conditioning workouts are more easier to run. I can train on a treadmill so what should I try to do to improve my stamina and fitness?

PS: If you are not familiar with 16s it may be called 17s but my basketball coach makes us do 16 laps instead. This consists of 16 laps of running the width of the basketball court in 60 seconds. If not done on time, the runners must do the drill again until they make it. Sounds simple but is excruciating when already exhausted from games."

130,Advice for improving step back jumper?,"I’m going into my senior year on varsity and have been trying to get my step back right. I’ve been watching Tatum and some of Doncic’s clips where they use the step back jumper and notice that they fade when they do it. I’m a 6”2 shooting guard and a lot smaller than them so I don’t think the fade is going to work for me in a game situation. 

I know I should prob be more focused on Steph because I’m closer to his height but I don’t have that quick release and I feel like if I try to go with harden ima get called for a travel every time :/

One of my friends is a great finisher and whenever he gets this shot off on me it always goes in.

135,"Why in contrast to other sports, the size difference in basketball is so tiny (3 inches at most) for balls for different age groups? Like the official NBA size is below 2 inches larger than a ball meant for 8 year olds?","To put an example a bat for a softball team of ten year olds will but around 1 foot. For 13 year old, they began to gradually extend it to near two feet. For teens its over two feet. For adults, size ranges from 2 and a half feet to over 3 feet as a the norm.

In soccer, a size 3 ball (for 7 year olds) looks like a whole third smaller than a size 4 ball used by 13 year olds. The official Size 5 Ball used not just by late teens and adults but as the official measurement by professionals like FIFA is a whole 3rd larger than a size 4 ball.

So I have to ask why the size gap differences are so tiny that its almost nonexistent in basketball? I mean a child's ball is 27 inches in diameter compared to 28 inches for early teens and 29 inches for high the official NBA league? The differences are so tiny that you ma as well give a child the NBA ball from the start since the almost nonexistent size differences don't add any noticeable weight differences that can impact child growth and cause more injuries in growing bodies. Where s in soccer a size 3 ball is under a pound while a size 4 ball is near a pound and and a size 5 ball is at least a pound and often exceeds that weight!

So why is the differences between basketball size so minimal? Is there really a big difference that a child would have playing with a 27 inch ball compared to the official 29 inch NBA size? Why are serious amateurs and pro players so picking about using a ball just 1-2 inches more width like its an breaking game changer?

Can anyone explain? I don't see how 28 inch teen ball to 29 inch pro ball is a life or death deal the same way a barely 2 feet long baseball bat VS a 2 and a half feet bat can decide a whole game for not just a single player but for an entire MLB game, possibly even the whole season!"

141,Quitting: Should you?,"Since covid, I’ve trained relentlessly for basketball with, like many others, for the eventual the goal of making it to the league. After over a year of training and playing small games (training by high level trainer in my area, playing small games too), I got the chance to play AAU for the first time. I had high hopes for this, as I was cut 2 times in 8th grade from previous teams in the past and had inconsistent minutes for my school, but I just used those experiences as motivation to work harder. My entire life for the past year and the half was for this summer. I trained insanely hard, gotten a ton more athletic, and just gave it my all. All the motivation came from that big goal, so the work felt easy to me, as in I never had to force myself to workout. I became really attached to basketball (which now I see was probably an issue), even becoming that “basketball guy” at school. Now, in 9th grade, with my skills the best they have ever been with proper training, and being the best physically in shape on the team, I was expecting to go crazy this summer season. However, that didn’t happen. I played horribly, scoring 4 points in 4 games, the defining point of my game, my 3point shot, was no longer showing up, and I was just disappointed in my self. I can tie a lot of this with the fact I didn’t play a real 5v5 in a while but still expect more of my self. With that, I still know that you should play for the love of the game, not for just making it to the NBA. But I think deep inside I may not actually love the game. At this point, should I quit the game? I now dread it, and it’s just a weird situation. One side I still have something that wants to make it, but on the other side I want to quit it and move on. I don’t know what to do man.

TL;DR: After training very hard for a year and becoming a much better player, I played terribly at aau. I now realize I may not love basketball and my main motivation probably came from “making it” to the NBA. I now dread practices and games. Should I stick with it or quit and move on?"

I was playing a half-court pickup game with my friend for about 45 minutes - 1 hour. On one possession I scored a basket and I saw another ball go in and to my surprise I turned around and six guys started playing on our court. Didn't even ask and started shooting and talking as if nothing was wrong. I wanted to say something, but the opportunity kind of passed as our court was taken over. I know I should've said something but I was so shocked people can be that rude. Is this common décor on the courts are are those people just assholes? I'm somewhat new to the game. 

I'll say something next time.

Yes, I've done my homework by reading online, but still don't understand. I was born in the EU and grew up with soccer, but I was getting interested into basketball so I picked up some 2K games. My only problem is, I don't understand how to defend. I thought it would be as simple as soccer, or even simpler. But I was so wrong. In soccer it mostly comes down ""go for the ball, don't hurt your opponent, and you're fine"". It's a much more physical sport where [tackles like these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQVfbe3OrsU) are perfectly fine (as long as you go for the ball and not for the leg). But in basketball, it seems like the only defense that I can put up is... standing still and maybe wave my hands in the air. When I try to reach the ball for stealing it from the opponent, a foul is called even if I barely touched the man. Somebody takes a shot and I intercept the ball? Foul. At every minimal physical contact, a foul is called on me. I'm starting to wonder if the only defense that exists in this game is a game of waiting  until your opponent makes a mistakes, like a shot off target, or a bad pass, or the ball is sent off the court, and intercept it."

I have been playing a lot of pickup too, and this has included playing against college players.  Based on the improvements I have felt, and how I've played in the pickup games (even though they aren't really comparable to real games), I believe that I might be good enough to play somewhere in college, maybe D3.  How would I go about finding somewhere to transfer to play if I am already attending a D1 school?"

I did not twist my knee or anything when playing and I could have even played longer. Felt fine after basketball until 2.5-3 hours after the session. I felt my knee stiffen up at the back of the knee and in front of the knee. 1-2 hours later when I go to bed the stiffness starts to turn into immense pain, like 10/10 pain and for 3 hours during the night I was literally not able to move my leg because of how much pain I was in. I took an anti inflammatory went to sleep and woke up 3-4 hours later. That immense pain was gone but my entire knee was tender and lost full extension and flexion of the knee joint. when I woke up in the morning, I was able to walk on it fine and put my entire weight on it fine but with that tenderness  and loss of full extension/flexion. The following day, I regained full flexion and extension and the knee was still tender. 6 days after I go to the gym to test it out, and I am able to do single leg squats, lunges with weights lateral jumps and so forth with no problem. The only difference I noticed is that the knee felt weaker than my right knee. 2 weeks after the ""incident"" today, my knee is almost 100% back to normal with just a bit of tednerness to the touch and still does not feel 100% strong like my other knee. I went to the doctor to get the ligaments checked and what not and its all good. I know the tests myself and tried it on my own and everything is good and sturdy. But does anyone have any idea why that happened or did anyone else experience something like that before?"

Filipinos likelier to do hard fouls and some are a bit sensitive on the ego side but most games are enjoyable. Offense calls fouls. They like to play fast breaks rather than half court slogs. 2-3 defense is common for full court games."

when i dribble, i tend to bounce the ball down, go under the ball as it goes up and basically hold the ball (i’m like 95% sure this is a carry) and then continue. and it only seems to work when i’m dribbling with my right hand. with my left, i just stroke the ball (pause) and kinda short arm each dribble until i lose control. in game, i can usually get the ball up the floor, but once any amount of pressure is placed while i dribble, i just throw it to the closest guy. any tips on how to improve my hands in ball handling, how to practice dribble moves to create space and make plays, and how to use the right footwork to get good, as well as developing confidence in handling the ball and making shots off the dribbles? Thank you!"

227,How in the world did scouts find Giannis and think he could be good enough to play in the NBA?,"Not a hate post at all. Really happy to see Giannis win a ring. But I find his story quite fascinating, especially because he was such an unknown commodity prior to being drafted.

He played in the Division 2 of Greek basketball league and was nowhere near as big or polished back then as a kid. He played somewhere where exposure was essentially nonexistent. Other European players played for more prominent clubs and achieve accolades to draw some attention (Luka played for Real Madrid and won an MVP there).

There are tons and tons of kids these days who can run and jump so what went through the minds of scouts when they scouted him and eventually drafted him? 

I'm just impressed because I would never think to even scour a Division 2 Greek league for potential NBA talent. But then again, I'm not a scout so kudos to those scouts."

288,Floater vs Super Close Pull Up,"I've been contemplating the floater as of late, I think it's a tough but crucial shot for guards. It's the giant killer as Shaq says. However, it is a tricky shot to learn and master.

Looking at tapes of nba floaters, I've found that, most of the time, there's enough time and space to just shoot the ball with two hands instead of tossing a the one handed floater. I think a super close jumper would be far more accurate and easier to learn than the floater. 

Ofc, the floater is better than the close jumper in tighter situations where speed and surprise are the only ways out. But again, most of the time you have enough time and space to put two hands on the ball. Two hands gives you a lot better control over your aim and power of the shot especially when you're in the air with momentum. 

What do you guys think?"
289,The real reason lebron number 6!!!,"After watching space jam: A NEW LEGACY, I have come to the realization. Idk if this has been discussed before but this is my theory. LEbRoN has always admired MJ. But lebron has also always outwardly portrayed “everything you can do, I can do as well” in regards to MJ’s legacy. Multiple time champion, have done that. A massive sneaker deal, achieved that. Lead in NBA league history records for various statistics, plenty records and still going. A new space jam movie, yeah that just released. The main and almost last available argument that fans use in MJ’s favor is: MJ HAS 6 NBA TITLES. Lebron currently has 4 at the moment. 

As one of the songs in the new SPACE JAM: A NEW LEGACY states “I’m here to SETTLE THE SCORE.” 

If lebron gets to attain 6 nba championships before the end of his professional career, does that make lebron James as the greatest of all time by NO CONTEST????

The number 6 has always represented the amount of NBA titles lebron has set to attain to achieve his goal of surpassing his idol.

290,Finger tip placement when shooting,"For my shooters weather its a catch and shoot situation or OTD  do you take the time to place your hands on the seams of the basketball or are you just positioning your hands wherever you catch it and letting it fly 
I personally think it’s okay to place your hands when you have a wide open set shoot but besides that i feel you can give the defense too much time to recover if its off the dribble and you’re trying to place you’re finger tips on the seams although for me having my fingertips on the seams gives me more rotation random question but just curious on everyone elses approach lmk what y’all think and how y’all go about it"
291,A lot of these analysts give such useless analysis. Let me explain,"It’s not just this year but for the NBA in general.

Whenever a player has a bad game or two, they start going to injuries, or fatigue, or choking and etc. But the next game if they have a good game, all that goes out the window.
You rarely ever see analyst talk about what did the other team do. For example, Chris Paul. Instead of thinking why he had a bad game or two was due to injury or fatigue, why not ask the question of what did the Bucks do differently? 

These so called analyst are so quick to pull the trigger on these players on a game to game basis that they don’t actually analyze what happened during the game. Why not credit the other team or player instead of criticizing the player who had the bad game.

It takes so much effort to shoot, it's tiring and it just feels WRONG now. So there are a couple of problems with my shot, but I just wanted to focus on a few things/questions, for now, only.

-when raising the ball from nearby my waist (the very beginning of my shot) up to my set point. If I wanted to make that process faster to get more momentum, is the only real way to make that happen, to simply just ""make it faster?""

-and when I get to my set point, I usually tend to use my entire arm to get to my release point (pushing with my shoulders, elbows, fingers, and wrist). But this always creates monumental tension and a chicken wing and I always miss short because of it... At my set point, should I only use my wrist/fingers to propel the ball from that point?

-and is ""legs and arms working together"" (synchronized)>""using more power from your legs"" if I want to get more range?

Maybe worth mentioning but I'm pretty new at basketball, I'm playing it without any coach just on my free time, do you think that perhaps I'm jumping wrong? Landing wrong? What should I think about in that regard?"

323,Best way to increase vertical jump?,"I already currently do weight training and plyometrics for one week but was wondering whether I should switch out plyometric work for jump training sessions instead (just jumping and touching the backboard). My plyometrics include lateral movements and core work as well, so I don’t know if it is worth it to switch it out? Is it a good idea? Do both methods create good results? Is one better than the other for increasing vertical jump?

Thank you. I know this is a lot, but I appreciate your time."
324,The problem with Team USA.,"First off all USA roster right now is the best roster in the world when it comes to individual quality but that is also some type of disadvantage... those players are used to play long minutes, scoring a lot, being the ISO player of the team, also lack some chemistry. 

I also think that USA don't take pride in playing for their national team. Players like Dončić value the opportunity to represent their country much more."
325,Real game vs. practice,"Today I played 2v2 and couldn't make the easiest shots, get pass my defender etc. I've been training alone and became very consistent with dribbling and shots. As soon as I stood before my defender I couldn't think of anything to pass him and just used my body advantage and did things that probably would be offensive fouls. 

Now to my question:
What can I do to transfer what I trained into my game. Those defenders really weren't good but neither am I, apparently."

328,"Help me solve for this pick-up ball ""who has next"" problem","We have a weekly 2 hour bball session, we rent 2 full courts, right next to each other, somewhere in between 26-30 people show up each week...

Everyone kinda knows each other, it's pretty friendly since we all pitch in to rent the gym... How do you figure out who has next?

Example:

\-Court 1 and Court 2 are running games, 7 people are waiting.

\-Court 2 finishes their game first, from the 7 waiting, first 5 to make FTs got next.

\-Court 2 starts new game, there are again 7 people waiting (the 2 who were already waiting and didn't make FTs + the 5 who just lost on Court 2)

\-Court 1 finishes game **10 minutes later**, what's fair at this point since the wait was so long? First 5 to make free throws out of all the 7 waiting **OR** the original 2 who didn't make it to Court 2 are automatically in, picking up 3 more from the losing team of the first game at Court 2?

\-Also, another curveball, let's say Court 1 and Court 2 are now both running their second game, you have about 7 people waiting, mix of losers from the first games at Court 1 and Court 2... Court 2 finishes their game, is there an order as to who has next? Should it be losers from Court 2 auto in since they've been waiting longer or it just doesn't matter at that point?

Anyways... I'm making this sound extremely complicated but we use to play on 1 court with 15 people and we had our first session with 2 courts tonight and people were getting confused about who has next and arguing a bit... anyone has a clean system to this?"

He averages crazy numbers (rounded up - 28/8/9) on good shooting splits, and he CARRIES an unlikely Mavs team to 6 games w/o KP last year vs the championship favorite Clippers. Then comes back this year and goes 7 games against them. Had the Hawks not traded him away to swap for Trae it’s safe to say they would be in the Finals.🤷🏽‍♂️ We all should know NBA greatness has a lot to do with luck of the draw with where you land. Would Kobe (🐐🐍) been as great if he stayed on the Hornets? Would AI be better if he wasn’t on the sixers? Dame in Portland? Carmelo? So I don’t think Luka should be negatively judged based off his playoff success or lack thereof without context🤌🏽. He’s taking your favorite WESTERN conference teams to 7 without a doubt with a less talented squad! Reminds me of LeBron with being a floor-raiser, being able to do more with less.

Can you do this as the offensive player? He made the basket because I couldn’t contest with no arms and I was just like uh.. is that not a foul? My team was just like eh it’s just pick up let’s not argue but in my mind that’s stupid since that just gives you an open layup every time.

344,Wondering how to balance effort/stamina,"Hey everyone. 

I consider myself relatively advanced in basketball in the rec league / pickup skill area. I have a PF body but I can smother guards on defense and I drive extremely hard to the basket with precise cuts and good handling. I pride myself on my handles and ability to change directions quickly. 

With that being said, because I play like a slashing guard in a big man’s body, I get tired fairly quickly and notice a drop off in my game in the 4th quarter. I know my conditioning could use some work, but I’m in good shape overall. 

My question is, is there any strategy to maintaining fitness throughout the game? I am best when I am creating chaos, diving for loose balls, making hard cuts/drives, and playing with emotion. When a game first starts, I try to play like Westbrook and virtually no one in my skill bracket can stop me with a head of steam. 

My play style is exhausting, but when I’m on, I generally control a game. Should I try to be more cognizant of the effort I’m exerting, maybe focus on going 90% effort all game, instead of 110% out the gates, just to become exhausted late in games?"

I recognize that the Globetrotters are putting on a show, but these guys obviously have insane shooting abilities and some of their trick plays would actually work in real scenarios I think.

So with that said, if they assembled 10 of the best Globetrotters of all time vs 10 of the best And1 stars of all time to play a 7 game series, who would win?

The players are all in their prime, and have three months to prepare and practice as a team.  Each team each can have coach, but for the sake of the question he's not big factor just a competent coach to call plays and changes-- its all on the players to win.  It's on an official NBA court with NBA rules and perfect referees.

352,Message for those wanting to play professional basketball,"Hey guys,

I know a lot of you guys have aspirations of playing basketball professionally and if that's your dream go for it. But this is an important message that needs to be said.

I have not played basketball at a high level (college) or professionally personally, but I've heard countless stories about it that it would be almost irresponsible to say it.

I have an injury and I had a talk with a doctor on how professional athletes' lives are. And the doctor says they have a lot of cartilage loss and a lot of nagging injuries (even if they dont admit it). That's the cost of doing athletics at a high level for a long time

You ever go for pickup run outdoors/indoors for hours at a time before? You can barely walk properly afterwards. People just think it's just fatigue but it's also the repetitive impact/damage on your cartilage in your knee and hips.  You only don't feel it because you're young.

The human body is not meant to play nonstop basketball at a high level for 3 decades, especially not on artifical hard ground that doesn't give like hard wood or  concrete/asphault. People are meant to walk, run and jump on mud, dirt, soil, grass, sand.

So many of the NBA players that played for nearly decades retire not just because their muscles might not be as fast-twitch, but because their joint cartilage has all been mostly gone it literally hurts to walk/jump (the bone touches bone). Every old player who could dunk when younger that can still dunk will probably tell you theyre scared to dunk because their joints will explode. 

Even genetic freak players heralded for longevity are not exempt from this problem. You ever see Lebron have crazy amount of ice packs taped to his knees after the game?

In the best case scenario, basketball courts should be played on a pliable/forgiving surface like rubber but I dont see that happening anytime soon. (This is why basketball shoes was invented with rubber soles, because immediate ground contact to hard surface would be too unrelenting on the joints)

If you truly think ball is life and want to play basketball for the rest of your life without your joints screaming at you afterwards, sorry to tell you that professional basketball isn't right for you.  

Listen, you can STILL play basketball at a high level. Your skills and athleticism can all be NBA level even though you're not in the league. If you want to taste what it's like to play basketball in the NBA you could go to rec centers that NBA players are known to go to and play against them.

If you want to make it to the NBA for the fame, reputation, or money, the nonstop travelling, it's just not worth it. You're sacrificing your own body and your ability to walk at age 60, or even 50.

I know that there are still people that will read all this and still not let the dream die, so here's what you should do to limit unnecessary damage to your cartilage:

1. Stop dilly dallying when you're playing basketball on a hard floor. Stop chucking half courts shots. stop playing when your body is already showing signs that you're gassed

2. Practice technique on the courts with hard floor but go game intensity on softer, more pliable floors. 

3. If you are financially well-off, get your own basketball court with a pliable, forgiving surface.


I wish you all the best."

354,Hi how can I improve on my weaknesses?,"Saw someone else did this so I'll try doing it too

Age: 14 (going into 9th grade)

Height: 5'11/180.5cm, predicted 183 cm/6'0.5

Weight: 121 lbs/55 kgs (my main goal currently is to get this up)

Ball Handling: B+, I dont get the ball stolen, I can break down defenders and get space, my main problem is that I'll instinctively just drive without doing any moves (it works a good percentage of the time), but it's going to be a weakness at the next level.

Shooting: A-, In practice and a set shot I shoot 60% from 3pt and 85% from free throw), however off the dribble and in games my shot is worse because I dont focus as well on the hoop (working on this)

Defense: C+, I don't know why, but I get easily faked out by shot fakes and jab steps. (idk how to improve this, tips?). I'm a good helpside and perimeter defender, but my interior defense is a D because I'm really skinny.

Passing: C, not amazing mess up sometimes on five man weave :| idk how to improve on this, tips?  
Playmaking D: never brung the ball up in game, or ran plays as the PG. 

finishing: C+, I can make tough shots, but I dont use euro steps or veer steps in games (gotta work on it). Usually I'll just drive one way and one two to the side and turn and shoot a a far away layup (which sometimes goes in, but sometimes hits the side of the backboard). Gotta work on advanced finishing moves. 

Athleticism: C, my vert is only 20-22 inches on a good day dont really train though so it's a good starting point. I also dont have much muscle because I'm skinny. However, I'm a really fast sprinter so I can get down the court super fast (I was the fastest one on my team). My lateral quickness is also pretty fast. 

Confidence: C, I don't take a lot of shots in game, I guess I'm just not confident in my abilities especially if I miss two shots in a row. Idk how to work on this.

Last season I played SF/PF because I was on of the taller kids on my team, but I'm going to transition into the PG role next season. Main thing I'm struggling with is ball handling and shooting in games, confidence, and playmaking."

For context, last year I played my 14 year old neighbor in 1-on-1 (JV high school player, six inches shorter than me); I lost 21-1 and got exhausted after a few possessions on defense. I have no dribbling ability and probably make about 30% of my shots in an empty gym. I’m also super unathletic and uncoordinated.

402,I gotta vent about this rn and I think y’all might be the only ones who could even understand me right now,"DISCLAIMER: *THIS POST IS LONG AS HELL*

Listen I know this isn’t a subreddit for pouring your heart out but I have nobody to go to, nobody would understand but other hoopers so I’m here. This might be a long one, and I don’t expect a huge interaction, I just need somebody to feel me I guess.

I’m ready to fucking quit. Straight up. I legitimately just played the worst game of my entire life, I have literally never been this fucking humiliated and ashamed of myself as a player and a person all around and I don’t know what the hell to do or think.

I’ve been playing ball my entire life it seems, I don’t think I’ve ever been more attached to anything more than this game. I’ve never fallen in love with a girl, but I know what love is because I deeply love this game. However, this shit just doesn’t seem to love me back.

I never played organized ball growing up, my parents couldn’t afford it in middle school and I was too scared to tryout in early high school, then I finally gained the courage to try out Junior and Senior year, where I was cut after the first tryout both years. I was always that skinny white kid who jacked up threes, but as I grew older I realized I wanted to be a more rounded player. I worked on my handle, mid range, layups, and passing but I still remained a shooter first by nature. 

Around two or three months ago I got extremely motivated to elevate my game, especially after taking such a liking to Jayson Tatum who is probably my favorite NBA player at the moment. I wanted to shape my game to be like his. I changed my shooting form, worked my ass off on mid range jumpers, step backs, and especially that side step. Ultimately I got extremely comfortable with that play style and felt like a way better overall scorer at any place on the floor rather than just a spot up three point shooter.

I started going to the local gym, playing pickup quite often. Confidence was sky high with this new skill set I’ve been working on and the first week or two going to that gym, I felt amazing. I started playing with some of the really good dudes though, running full court 5’s, and I think that’s where I started to lose that confidence I had. 

These dudes were still way better than me, I almost never got the rock during games and when I did I got ripped or bricked the shot. I kept my head up though, I knew I was good as hell, I just wasn’t confident. Some days I played decent, some days I was kinda trash, but I kept playing anyways.  Until today...

I haven’t been able to play much this week, but I finally got the time to go today after work. I got there, started getting shots up, doing warm up dribbles, waiting to see if a game was gonna start up. All the really good local guys showed up, like 15 of em. The 5 on 5 games started, and I got dropped. Nobody picked me, so I watched the first game on the bleachers. Game ends and I got next so I get out there and we start up the next game, I was ready to prove these assholes wrong for no picking me first.

This game was fucking horrendous, I had a terrible mismatch as an assignment, The guy was at least 80 lbs bigger than me, strong as hell. I was struggling on defense. Early in the game I got and open corner three and straight airballed, but no big deal. The real kick in my ass was the fastbreak that’s followed a few possessions later. They throw it down court to my teammate who was wide open, and I was running his way. He passes my the ball which surprised me, saying he didn’t want the easy points.... I then proceeded to MISS THREE WIDE OPEN FUCKING LAYUPS WITH NO DEFENSE IN SIGHT. My teammates were down court YELLING at me “BRO MAKE THE FUCKIN LAYUP ARE YOU SERIOUS” and I missed all three, then an opposing player gets the rebound and I’m back on defense.

That shit was humiliating and my confidence was at its lowest. I didn’t get the ball the rest of the game. Around the end of the game it was close and my teammates were trying to come back, I was doing my best to lock up on defense. A pick came that I didn’t go over and the guy got an easy three, which resulted in all my teammates yelling at me for not stepping up. We lost the game 15-12.

I literally started tearing up on the fucking bench dude. Went to the bathroom to collect myself, then I just took my shoes off and went home. I’ve never cried so hard over this game. It felt like I just broke up with the love of my life. I legitimately feel like I should never touch a ball again. I worked so hard for years and more to get better every day, and I felt like I was so good until I started playing bad and just got worse and worse. 

This shit is hurting me more than anything right now, I’m typing this with a broken heart because I feel like it’s not even worth playing anymore, i feel like I just fucking suck and I always will even though in my heart I know that I’m good as hell at this game, but I crack under the pressure every single time I try playing with anyone better than me and I look like trash. I don’t even want to show my face in that gym again.

If you even read all of that I truly appreciate you, honestly I feel like nobody is actually going to read this much on Reddit, especially for a kid they don’t even know whatsoever. Anyways, I needed to get that out, to somebody who might understand how I feel or something."

421,Operation 'Old Man Game' starts now. My (27) mission to become one of the best on the court by the time I'm 50.,"Like the title says, I am 27 years old and have been playing basketball since I was a little kid. But the issue is that this was just at the park/gym, never had any formal training so I am limited because of it. At 6'3 I am usually the tallest or second tallest on the court so I developed a big man game, catching boards, protecting the rim, and posting up on the block . But I'm getting bored of that, nobody passes me the ball and I feel like I stick out as big but uncoordinated presence. The other day I played against an 55 year old man and then it hit me, I want to be balling at that age. If I could get like 25 years to work on my game I think I could run some floors (barring D2 and D3 playing) through my 30's and 40's until I get to 50. 

That is the goal now, I'm gonna improve my game within the next 20ish years and dominate the young kids. I need a consistent jumper, improved handles, and whatever consists of the ""old man game"".

If you have any tips or examples to follow they will be greatly appreciated. But starting now ""Operation Oldman Game"" is in effect."

423,What if there is a 4 point line?,"Let's consider this basketball variant. Use the high school 3 point line for 3 pointers.

Any shot behind it be worth 4 points.

There will be no 3 second rule and bigs or anyone can stay in the paint to make the game more fair and balanced for inside scorers.

431,How I've gone from a terrible to a bad shooter,"I wanted to share with you, who may also be very bad at shooting, a few tips, that helped me to hit shots more consistently. On some days I couldn't even get 10/30 FT, just a couple weeks later it's sometimes above 20/30. I did common mistakes, I think, so it could definetely help others.

One crucial factor was the curve/arche of my shot, most of the times I hit the backboard because it was too flat. I noticed that, when I shot with only one hand it had a much better and higher curve, so I figured it must have something to do with my offhand. I fixed that by:

1. Turning my feet to the left (im righthanded) a little bit (15° max.)

2. Jumping forward a little bit (I noticed Curry and other shooters do that)

3. Letting the ball go a long time before releasing (I don't think you should do that but jt helps me)

4. Raising my shooting hand up straight and paying attention to my elbow being above my eyes while releasing


So everything is pretty obvious and of course I improved because I trained nearly everyday"

447,Should I change my shooting hand?,"Hey so I've been in a bit of a dilemma recently. I have been playing basketball for 10 years. When I was a kid, I shot two handed especially from mid range and three until I was like 13 or 14, with using my left more than my right when I shot. Eventually at 14, my form became a one motion shot primarily involving my left hand shooting the ball and my right hand being a guide hand. I have developed strong muscle memory since then and it does sort of feel natural to shoot with my left hand up until now, and im 18. But the thing is... I'm right handed in my everyday life. It is my stronger arm. I write with it. I told someone I shoot with my left even though I'm right handed and they told me it was unnecessary. I normally go for right hand floaters and layups because they feel easier--more natural for me. I'm just stuck on whether I should change my shooting hand if it will make it easier to shoot or allow me to shoot from farther later on in my life. Should I change my shooting hand to my right?

455,My first (actual) in-game dunk,"So yesterday we were running 5 v 5 at my local gym. It was a good competitive group, and was tons of fun. At my gym, they have 2 courts. One of the hoops on the first court is bent way down, so it's only like 9' 8"" and I have dunked on that during a game before, but it was not that impressive and felt like hacking a little bit. Anyways, we played on the second court (with normal 10 foot rims) and I poked the ball away starting a fast break. Now, I can pretty easily dunk with 1 hand and 2 hands. The problem is, it is hard to grip the ball in my palm without traveling cause it takes awhile to get a good grip. With 2 hands, I can only dunk off 2 feet which is harder to do in a game off a fast break. But, I was alone on my side of the court and I went up and flushed in through with 1 hand. It was a great feeling, and I hope to get more consistent in dunking. I'm new to this sub, and I'm interested in all your experiences with your first in-game dunk 🏀"

492,I feel like basketball has a huge chance of expanding globally the next few decades if the NBA invests more in Chinese basketball talent.,"&#x200B;

We're already seeing basketball talent in Europe expand these last two  decades. Especially in the Balkans. So I think the NBA should continue  what they're doing in the European market. I think that market will get  better and better. But I think the market they really need to tap into  more is East Asia. Most specifically China.

China  loves basketball and they have 1.4 billion people. That's a huge  market.  What the NBA needs to do is tap more into that market. They  should groom and invest more in Chinese basketball talent. What they  need is a Chinese Michael  Jordan/Kobe Bryant/Lebron/Curry in the NBA.  Think about it. Basketball  has a huge market in China. Over a billion  people in China. So just  imagine if there was a Chinese basketball  player in the NBA who is as a  good as MJ/Kobe/Lebron/Curry? Winning  mvps, final mvps, championships.  Such a player would not only have the  American basketball market but  also China/East Asia market.

Yao   Ming, a great but relatively boring player, already boosted the NBA's   popularity in China in the 2000's just because he was Chinese. So   imagine a 6 foot 6 Chinese guard or forward, very exciting with amazing   skills winning championships, mvps, final mvp? Such a player would make   basketball even more popular in China and more global.

So  that's my opinion. I think the next 50 years the NBA should continue  what they're doing in Europe. But in China they need to do so much more.  I think it's in their best interest to find a Chinese talent that has  the potential to be an all time great. I think if they do this, the next  50 years basketball could be like the third most watched sport in the  world"

Maybe I'm doing it wrong or during the wrong moments, but whenever someone tries to sham me, I can tell they are going to sham right before they even do it because of the unnatural way that people kinda push the ball before they snatch it with the off hand.

So I would like to walk memory lane with you today:  


What was your BEST GAME EVER?  
Rules: There are none. Even if it was only one steal you made that felt awesome, I wanne hear!  


For the start:   
Around 7 years ago, I truly experienced ""being in the zone"" and I remember EVERY detail about the game. 

It was my best season and I was in great shape. We wanted to move up one division but lost two crucial games, so moving up was out of the picture. One of our last games was against the team who also wanted to move up, it was their last game and they needed to win. 

I was REALLY hungover from the night before, because my roomate broke up with his girl the day before. 

I played 36 minutes, scored 39 points, shooting 9/12 threes and didnt miss another layup or shot. I was beside myself. That wasnt me and my gf watched the game once with me and said that I had ""the look of a frightend chicken before the beheading.""  


My eyes were WIDE OPEN, I couldnt pay attention in time outs and I looked almost confused. 

It was amazing and I finished the game off by blocking the same (now pro) player twice on the same spot. They isolated him twice, on my side, because they KNEW FOR A FACT that I was the weakest individual defender on our team. Which was 100% true. 

Left side corner, I was a PF and took him 1v1, he got to the basket and I blocked him, got the rebound and passed two long outlet passes for layups.   


All I remember from that sequence is screaming ""THERE YOU GO! THERE YOU GO!!"" from the top of my lungs and him walking to the bench. 

&#x200B;

I will never forget this game and how it felt like a outter body experience.   


NOW YOU! :)

&#x200B;

And have a nice weekend and a wonderful friday!"

Edit:
To clear somethings up, by 80 percent I referred to practicing at game speed without a defender."
561,What’s acceptable down low in the post?,"Kind of a long question here but I had a frustrating game and I’m looking for opinions. 

I’m 32 y/o, 6’3” 195lbs. Playing ball all my life. Mostly pickup. I’ve lived in NYC the past 9 years and always played outdoor and indoor. I’m pretty lanky and if I can I prefer to play the 3 or 4, running on the fast break, cutting to the basket, quick pull-up jumpers etc.

But since I’m 6’3” I often end up playing the 5 and banging with the other big guy and I’m usually up for it. I notice especially nowadays some dudes who play underneath have really bad off the ball habits and a messed up idea of what physical defense actually is. This game was an example.

I just played 3 games against a dude down low who would constantly defend my post up and box out with either his elbows up and in my back or his closed fists bracing me like a hand check. Like I would back down and instead of opening up he would cross his arms high and meet me like he was screening. It was subtle mostly but it was frustrating as hell because I felt like I’m getting fouled constantly but it’s just these body blows. He got me in the gut hard the same way as I was going straight up on him and I stupidly didn’t call thinking I had the bucket. He was a pretty average player overall, not much of a scoring threat so it was more frustrating that he was putting all this effort into dirty play.

I’ve always understood defending the post up as either a) an open hand check on the players back to maintain distance and anticipate the drop step or b) open body arms open out or up bracing the offensive players advances with the chest and trying to hold ground. And same with boxing out. You can gain position using your hips, your back and your foot placement but not with too stiff fists or elbows pushing the opponent. 

I didn’t say anything. I got shots other ways. But when you’re the big guy guys expect you down low. Another dude I played one run against actually understood this and we had a fun tough game against each other. So it kinda made this guy stand out. 

What do you think? Is this something you run into? Is this just normal part of pickup stuff? (I mean, it is) does it maybe have to do with the general lack of post play and less understanding of what’s proper? I’m not quitting basketball over this but y’know, would what I’m describing piss you off?"
562,Motivation: it's not too late to play basketball,"I thought that you might need some motivation so i'm  gonna share this with you.

I haven't played basketball in almost 10 years. 10 freaking yeaaaaars!  It took me almost 1 year to decide that i miss basketball that much that I would find a place to return to the game. 
I'm not in high school anymore so I really though I might not be able to play anymore due to extra weight, extra worries, over thinking. 

I went by myself a few times at a court to shoot a bit, quite embaressed about myself. It improved my spirit but it was not enough.


TODAY was the day! 
In the last days I found the right strangers to organize and go play. I was sooooo nervous. I was really thinking I would play sooooo bad.

TODAY was a gift. Game day!
I realized that my body remembers everything: how to guard, how to shoot, how to dribble, how to see the game. I totally disconnected my mind from anything else, disconnected from work, disconnected from the outside world.
This was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!

If you are worried that you couldn't get back to basketball, stop it.

564,Is getting your jumper right really that frustrating or is it just me?,"I can’t count how many times my jump-shot has gone from complete shit to Curry level over the past 3 years or so. So often I’ll find myself in a stride— so comfortable with my jumpshot that I’d feel confident pulling up from half court if I was given the space, to not being able to even pull up from less than 10 feet away the next week for about a month or so, until I force my jump-shot back to the way it was after rigorous practice just to find the one little, tiny, almost invisible mistake I was making that ruined the whole shot motion. It’s not like I don’t train when I have my shot, since I play almost everyday. 

It’s one of the most frustrating things I find with basketball since I am a small guard and need to be able to shoot. It’s even more annoying when you’re expected to shoot after a good performance only to be a complete bust the next day. 

What am I doing wrong? Is shooting overrated? Should I just become Ben Simmons? Is this the way to play basketball? Was he 9000IQ all along?

I know this post may come off as a rant or vent but if you have any input that could help me, I’d appreciate it."

With that, a question came in my mind, “What if *insert NBA player here* joined the Warriors?” without considering salary caps, trade offers, etc. By no means do I think these are possible, but just fun to theorize:

• LeBron - Everyone has always wondered the potential a Lebron-Curry duo would have and we had a glimpse of it during the All-Star game. I just think as they both enter the later ages of their lives, having a season together would be super entertaining and could possibly produce another ring.

• Dame - Highly unlikely but Steph, Curry and Klay as the 1, 2 and 3 would be a crazy floor-spacing team. Threes could rain in just like the All Star game and it COULD work with the right supporting pieces around them. 

• Giannis - A playmaking shot creator with unlimited range paired with an agile, lengthy slasher that dominates the paint? I think that’s crazy space and defenses would have a hard time containing Curry and the Freak.

These are the players I thought of, I wanna know what other opinions y’all may have. 

NOTE: These are just hypothetical scenarios. I just think it’s fun to explore the thought."

604,Armbars during a Post Up,"Me and my friend had an argument on what is and what is not allowed when we were playing pickup. This was mainly due to him (who is bigger than me) posting up and using an arm bar to create space. He doesn’t necessarily fully extend his arm, but it always hits me directly in the chest and doesn’t allow me to attack the ball on defense. He is also doing this while dribbling to which he would often take a step back and use the space he got from the arm bar to take a shot. Is he allowed to dribble up to the post, see he doesn’t have space, use an armbar, keep dribbling, and do whatever he wants with that space while I can’t do the same on defense?

606,Dont Know if I should quit,"Hey guys looking for some advice here

I used to really love the sport of basketball, and I trained for hours upon hours every day. I am willing to go to the park or gym and play runs there for several hours straight. I consider myself a pretty good player, as I have played high-level AAU and high school basketball for multiple years. However, high school basketball is taking the fun out of the sport, and I am beginning to lose my love and passion for it. My coach will attempt to tear us up if we make the smallest error in practice, and our practice consists of 4 hours of nonstop yelling. My coach has been tearing away confidence from not only me but the whole team. In games, our coach gives us zero freedom, usually making us run plays that barely work. Nobody on my team looks forward to going to practice, and we are constantly checking the time to see when practice is going to end. Apart from that, high school basketball is taking up a large portion of my summer, and I am often thinking about how much fun I would be having if I did not participate in high school basketball. My stress has been extremely bad from playing high school basketball. Every time I think about high school basketball, I think about the dreadful practices and games, and how much easier life would be if I did not join the team. I have noticed that recently, I have not been training as much as I used to, and I have been feeling unmotivated. I have not even been looking for the season to start. Sometimes I wish I was injured or out for the season, so I would not have to deal with the stress of playing under my coach. I have been looking forward to the day that my senior season ends, so I wouldn't have to play in such a stressful environment. But then again, I feel that since I am an incoming senior, this is my last chance to actually play real organized basketball, and I feel that if I miss this season, I might look back at this and regret my decision of quitting. I have been playing AAU and school basketball for 8 years, and I feel like I may be taking this opportunity for granted. I am really unsure of what I should do, and would really want to know what you guys think.

614,Finishing in traffic,"

I’d be nice to have some advice from some more… seasoned players (a coach would be fantastic) but I’ll take anything

So over the pandemic I’ve worked hard on my defense and it’s really paid off. I’m usually on the most dangerous or athletic scorer and I can handle them pretty well (I occasionally will take the big too cus I’m 6’4 but I got another guy on my squad that does just fine with them because he’s super strong and solid.). But offensively , I’m getting a little frustrated. I have a good midrange game and the pick and pop works wonders for me. But my three needs work and inside I’m starting to get flustered 

I can get rebounds and score on an open lane but when there’s traffic I start to have issues. I’m always getting fouled or doubled and it really gets annoying after a while getting so harassed. I’m pretty much always forced to post up and fade away or kick it out to an open guy if I’m doubled. And honestly this works fairly well. My fadeaways not bad and I get a lot of assists but overtime my post game gets extremely one dimensional and guys start countering it. And then I don’t really know what to do except play more outside which Is frustrating cus it’s not my role on the team.

So if anyone has any tips or drills (drills would be super helpful) for finishing inside in traffic and getting through people, scoring with contact, etc, I would be so grateful.

Thanks in advance."

I'm also pretty gung-ho when it comes to things I'm passionate about. I've read a lot of books and listened to podcasts concerning basketball, training, diets, etc.

And I'm mainly writing this because I feel a bit bogged down from the pressure from my parents telling me, ""What happens if you get injured?"", or ""Only a few people actually make the NBA, so why would you?"".

And just for some extra clarification, I train in my driveway that is pretty narrow, and I don't have much money to get a private trainer.

632,My Opinion As To Why Jordan Is Considered The GOAT,"Any basketball fan in the world knows that Jordan is considered the GOAT. Whether or not you agree with that varies but he is looked at as the model for excellence in basketball. I obviously know Jordan was great on the court, but I think what makes him the unanimous GOAT is what he did off the court as well. He was the first from his era to be casted in a big Hollywood production, he has probably the most famous line of shoes ever made, he did all the brand deals with McDonald’s, Gatorade, Nike, and more. My point is he was a great basketball player but he was also a great businessman, and he was the first to do it that way. 

We now see people like Lebron, KD, Steph and more venturing into the business world on the side while playing basketball but Jordan kicked that door down for the players, he was the first to do it which is why I believe it adds on to his legacy as the GOAT"

I wanted to be like a spot up shooter/3 and d sort of guy, but I've realized that my height probably won't let me do that. So does anyone have any point guard tips for me? I'm not used to dribbling the ball in games, usually I'll get the ball on the wing and either shoot or drive. I've honestly never taken the ball up the court in a game before. My handles are good, I don't lose the ball easily, but I don't have a bag at all. My go-to get-pass-my-defender move is just a crossover or innie float drive. I've been working on my pull up shots and stuff. Also, whenever I go to tryouts I get super nervous and can't shoot/dribble/play defense properly. What skills do I need to become a good PG?

Sophomore year (13) because of my height I've always been a standout for my age group (i guess) so the coach wanted me to tryout for the basketball team, so the current basketball team vs the tryouts. It started with a casual 1v1 and i absolutely torched every single player (cause we ran king of the court) I even almost put the best tryout player in a poster he 6'1 btw and the other players are also relatively tall. But when we played 5v5's I was absolute trash like I can't run plays,
Turnovers, I can't even get passes from my teammates ended up getting blown out 15-30 and I think it's my fault. But i was still able to make the team because of my height I guess. And the funny thing is, the MVP of the tryout team in the 5v5's was the one i almost put in a poster."

I jumped straight up to contest the layup and go for the block. While I was in the air he was in the two step motion and jumping he used his off arm to push me while I was in the air.

681,You won't be able to do everything on the court...,"  Some may look at it as a disappointment, but I never understood why people wanted to be able to do everything. Of course, there will always be someone who excel at everything on the court, but I think some players fail to realize that every role is just as important even if it may have little impact. 

For example, grabbing rebounds is a slept on role. Just by grabbing a rebound, not only do you secure your team a posession with the ball, but you actually boost their confidence to take shots because they know your rebound ability and efforts are present on the court.

Not to get it confused, I only play basketball for fun and can understand just having fun. Although, 70% of time I do play there's always someone who believe they're a complete 'Demi-God' and can do everything. In reality, they're just an average player if not below with a huge ego.

Was thinking is there a market for already broken in balls, not for the NBA or professional players (they have equipment staff that does that job  and provides such balls) but for amateur players, basketball enthusiasts  or who searches for best ball experience?

687,Building an All-Time Optimal Lineup around Rajon Rondo,"Being a 2x NBA champ, 4x All defense team member, 3x assist champ, and a one-time steals leader makes Rajon Rondo one of the premier point guards of all-time. Even with his inability to shoot, Rondo found a unique way to carve out one of the better careers in NBA history. 

However, the lack of shooting is what the lineup will focus on. Rondo’s defense was always above average to elite so offensive wings are needed, and a potential lob threat down low. 

At point guard, Rajon Rondo is the player to build around. He is one of the better Jekyll and Hyde situations when it comes to his play in the regular season compared to his play in the playoffs, and his two rings show it. For the sake of this lineup, we are imagining Prime Rondo in the early 2010’s averaging 14 PTS, 11 ASTS, and 2 STL a game. 

At shooting guard, offense is needed. He does not need to be someone that has to put the ball on the floor and does not have to be elite defensively either. Bring in Michael Redd of the Milwaukee Bucks to pair with Rondo. Redd has capability to stretch the floor, shown by his 38% career three-point percentage. He can catch-and-shoot, or even create his own shot if needed. Redd’s scoring ability made this choice an easy one. 

At the small forward, versatility with more three-point shooting makes the floor spacing and can make the defense even better. Here I am looking at a Richard Jefferson during his Nets days. His ability to play defense on either small or power forward and ability to score at an efficient rate makes him a unique fit in the roster constructed so far. 

Looking at the 4, a lob threat that can stretch the floor would be quite the hand-in-glove fit along with Rondo. Do not investigate this too much further, Blake Griffin is a prime candidate to play with Rondo. Forming a lob city tandem and being able to play pick-and-pop with a passer of Rondo’s caliber makes this the driving force of the offense.

Anchoring the defense at the center position, I am looking for a big that will lock down the paint. Having Rondo being able to funnel a guard into the paint locked down by one of the best defensive big men in history is the vision. So, bring in Alonzo Mourning to be my anchor. The 2x DPOY and 2x block champion will fit the bill and then some.

Coming off the bench is former Chicago Bull sixth man of the year, Ben Gordon. Gordon has the capability of making the team play small ball while he plays the small forward or play bigger at the shooting guard position. His career 40.1% behind the arc fits the mold of what we are looking for as well.

PG: Rajon Rondo
SG: Michael Redd
SF: Richard Jefferson

Also consider this, I'm dribbling and a player tries to reach from around me and tries to knock ball out of my hand, from fiba rule book, a legal guarding position is where defense is facing the player and both foot  on ground.

I don't have a quick first step, I can barely take contact in the air, I can hardly set my feet properly after coming to a stop off the dribble to shoot, and my lower back gets sore pretty quickly. All of this is pretty unsurprising given I have a very sedentary job with long hours, and I'm sure no small part of it has to do with just a general decline in skill that comes with not playing for a long time, but I figure a lot of it is because I'm just not as mobile  as a teenage/early 20s me.

701,Why Bill Russell is better than Wilt Chamberlain.,"I want to be humble in this topic because I have never seen Wilt or Bill play. So most people look at it as Bill won because he had a better team, but Wilt was better individually. And that's a myth. Wilt didn't lose because Bill's team was better. Most people will say ""Bill had 4 hall of famers"". But the amount of help Bill had was overrated. KC Jones averaged 7 points! And he's a hall of famer. Another Sanders was a great defender, but his 10 points ain't hall of fame. Also Wilt had a lot of hall of famers with him before LA. Wilt had about 3 hall of famers each year with him. Wilt lost because he choked!

1960: Don't Blame Wilt so.

1961: He lost in the 1st round to an underdog team.

1962: The Celtics and the Warriors had pretty similar help both teams had 3 players scoring 20 a game or more. In game 7 Wilt scored 22 points. Look you might be laughing, but Wilt put up 50 a game.

1963: Wilt averaged 45 points, but his warriors missed the playoffs with other hall of famers with him. 

1964: Don't blame Wilt too much.

1965: Again they both had equal help, but Wilt still lost? 

1966: Game 2 he shot 9 of 22 and game 4 he put up 22 points.

1967: What a series from Wilt

1968: Wilt below a 3-1 lead

1969: In game 6 and 4 he put up 8 points.

Why did Wilt lose so many times to Bill? When they had equal help. And some years the warriors had a better record then the Celtics. Also, Wilt's 50 points a game season is blown out because he took over 40 shots a game in the fastest pace era. He never sat out. The reason Wilt couldn't win against Bill was because Bill was better."

703,Better Endurance = A Better Shot,"Better everything really. 

This is probably an obvious observation, but I’ve noticed the better my endurance gets the better my shot gets. 

Maybe because my focus is more intense/has more stamina. 

I don’t know the point of diminishing returns (the point where more endurance does not improve your shot). 

But for me I notice my shots are wet as my stamina improves.

I’m not even doing anything basketball specific. I swim 4x a week for an hour in the mornings. 

Obviously, the opposite is true. The more tired/sweaty you get, the worse your game becomes. That’s true with anything.

706,How in the world do you stop fadeaways,"**Ok imagine this, you're strong but your opponent is stronger, you're tall but he's just as tall, he posts up on you but you manage to make him uncomfortable and not be able to move properly. Now he's near to the basket, just a step forward from the free throw line. You know he's been doing the fadeaways and you see it coming, but then he does it, makes it and you can't seem to catch up because he bumps into you before doing it. That's not the only move I hate. Another move is some hook shot where the guy posts up then shoots a hook like shot from his hand furthest away from me. So the tip I'm looking for is, is it strength, speed or technique I need to work on. There are a few times where I manage to keep him away from fadeaways by going left and right quickly and trying to knock the ball from his hands but sometimes he hits me with a spin or a fake.**"
707,RANT: playing with groups of friends,"Is there anything worse than playing 5s with a group of 3-4 people that are friends with each other but not you?

The outcome is predictable. They only pass to each other and take 95% of the shots. Doesn’t matter if you have the best match up/are wide open, you’re not getting the ball. 

Only chance of getting the ball and a shot is getting a rebound. So you gotta work twice as hard to get half the touches you normally do. And the second you get a rebound you get 4 dudes calling for the ball and standing absolutely still until you pass it. 

Try to complain about and your automatically 1v3/4 and are just gonna look like a complainer.

         Whenever I try to make a play or make an ill-advised pass I get screamed at. Whenever anybody else on the team does something like that he doesn’t even give a second glance. He thought that I mumbled under my breath one time (when I genuinely didn’t say anything at all) and practically took my head off. If anyone has any advice or ideas to make life a little easier then that would be great.

721,Can I keep an indoor ball in a hot car?,My car gets pretty hot during the day (Over 100°). I normally head to the gym straight after work so I won't have a place to keep my ball other than the trunk of the car. Would that mess it up badly/significantly shorten its lifespan?

730,Could Zion have joined the Knicks through the G-League?,"Please excuse my lack of understanding of the NBA, I am a new fan of the game.

Could Zion Williamson, instead of declaring for the NBA Draft, have joined the G-League, only to immediately sign a contract with the Knicks? From my research online, Zion could have chosen to declare for the G-League draft, where he would be chosen as the first overall pick. Could he at that point immediately arrange a contract with the Knicks? Obviously Zion would immediately be one of, if not the, greatest basketball player to be associated with the G-League, so the move would be highly unusual."

After taking a 5-6 hiatus I decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and start playing some pick up for fun as well as help my old aau coach with coaching younger. Playing against some high schoolers and watching young kids play makes me feel like a boomer. It's just crazy that when I was growing up everyone wanted to be Jordan/Iverson Esque break down your defender and get to the rim either with a dunk or an athletic finish. Lot's of high post or mid post turn around jumpers. Now everyone wants to jack up 3s and shoot step backs from random pick up dude at the gym to 7 year old that I'm coaching. I didn't realize the steph curry effect until now.

Not falling for fakes on defense?,"So as summer started and school ended, I've been playing more ball and I have been trying really hard on Defense, staying low moving quick and it is a lot of work and often makes me really tired. Also, I easily get faked and give people big space because I fall for the slightest movements.  Plus in the paint people who are stronger body me or people taller just put their arm up, the worst thing the do is put their butt towards me and stretch their back really far out and then stretch their arms so i cant get the ball and then quickly shoot it when I clearly cannot reach it. So any tips on defense on how to not get tired and also on how to not get faked at the slightest movement?"

744,could I play any position? IMPORTANT,"my coach asked me what position I play and I said ""I could play any"". I got put under pressure when he asked me so I said what first came into mind.

age - 14

height - 5""9.5

weight - 150 pounds

max reach - 9 foot 4

vertical - 22 inches (just came back from an ankle sprain)

defence - 3.4 steals, 2.1 turnovers and 1 block. (18.8% of shots go in when I'm defending)

ball handling - 6/10 pretty decent.

shooting - 6.8/16.2 from field. 0.45/2.0 from 3. (22.5% from 3 and 41.9% from the field.)

rebounding - 8.0 every game. past 3 games - 12.0 rebounds

IQ - I have a very high basketball IQ on defence and a pretty good IQ on offence. (I know which passes the other team will make and I intercept them and transfer them into points on the other end of the court).

strength and speed - fastest with ball and without ball. strongest player on the court most of the time but don't ue my strength to my advantage at all, I do use my speed to my advantage most possessions.

height and strength advantage - I'm 2-3 inches taller and 14 pounds heavier than the average on my team.

what possessions can I play? thank you"
745,Bucks win the finals. Come back to this post after the finals.,
746,Are the Suns about Chris Paul or Devin Booker?,Because I see some folks arguing that the Suns can't go to the WCF or finals without CP3. Ridiculous. Are they even playoff worthy without cp3's leadership? Yes.
747,Trade Cp3 for Ben Simmons,"This should be close to a straight up swap. If you're Philly, you're trading a light blue chip for an aging superstar that could take you to the finals. That's almost even money. Get a first rounder in '23 for Simmons and both teams will come out ahead. Phoenix can operate without a scoring PG but could flourish with an initiating PG with close to bucket skills and +defender. Make Simmons cut and dunk in the half court after dropping it off to Booker. Cp3 hits big shots and is an all time distributor. Perfect for Philly to retool with dedicated shooters in the starting lineup and on the bench"

751,Interesting rules question for any referees here: dead ball technical,"Was in an adult rec league game playing under high school rules tonight. Team A (my team) was up by 3 with 40 seconds left, so team B is fouling. 

Team A is coming out of time out and inbounding, and Player A1 (me) is hugged by player B1 to the point I can't even move before the ball can be inbounded. The reasoning for this was that I'm the big man and am not very good at free throws. 

Well, the ref calls it a dead ball technical foul, and my questions lies here, is this truly a dead ball technical foul? My second question; does player A1 have to shoot or can anybody on team A shoot since it's a technical foul?

We (team A) ended up winning but it was an interesting scenario."

784,Rudy Gobert is one of the most overrated players in the NBA.,"Look I thought a star player, a top 25 player in the NBA would get better in the playoffs, but a player like Terence Mann would go at Rudy he's the frickin DPOY. Also, I thought the DPOY would also be able to guard the perimeter. When the Clippers were using there small ball lineup Rudy showed no effort. He doesn't have pride defending the basket. When Dwight Howard was in his prime he showed pride in defending the basket, but not Rudy. When Rudy is not defending the basket. He's Andre Drummond. D Mitch is better theirs no debate about it. I know the DPOY is suppose to be a regular season award, but Rudy should get a lot of hate for what he's doing this series. I have seen Reggie Jackson going at Rudy, Mann, most of the Clippers points were in the paint. I think this team should trade away Rudy, but which team needs Rudy. The Mavs need him, but the best offer that they can get for Gobert is KP, Dorian Finney Smith, and like 6 first rounds and some pick swaps. I don't like that trade for the Jazz those picks won't amount to anything. The Celtics best offer is probably some role players and picks."

I haven’t added any muscle in fact I look even skinnier. note: I gained 2 inches during this school year and my voice got much deeper but im still skinny and narrow shouldered. Could it be growth spurt, athletic spurt, or something else. I got skinnier but i feel stronger as well."
800,"Does having a consistant post hook from mid range make me a hooper hooper or a hoopiest, or just a hoop? lol","I had also seen a few months ago someone asked if having a consistant hook eliminates the need for a fade away, i would say it doesnt matter if you are in rythm, but a post hook is easier as you only need 1 hand and you can use another to fend off a defender, whilist a fade away requires a left arm aiming motion with more emphasis on a wrist flick, a sky hook does eliminate, yet sometimes that left hand motion adds more rythm, i would say it is only equal when your footing is off, that adjustment can be a nice save, if i am posting up right hand dribbling, a post hook is easy, but if a defender is up close, you have to go left, one legged fade away, since i cant hook with left hand, so my post moves are hook, ben simmons esque rathe than kareem, and my dirk fadeaway, consistant on euros and floaters, behind the back cross over between the legs mid range step back, i have no 3 point shot, or running mid range shots"

( i know the answers and inviduell) but it really made me depressed that day lol.i was litterly  20 minuten just trying to goal at every position and failed miserably.like outta 20 minutes of constante shooting i got like 3 goals and these were just lucky ones .

Let’s say you’re driving to the rim on a fast break and get fouled.  Let’s say you get fouled then take an extra step, is it a travel? Or is it just overlooked?  Seems like it’s usually not called If it’s an extra step and is overlooked."
815,How to tell when teammates are catching fire?,"I play pg for my HS varsity team, I'd say I'm pretty good at finding my teammates but Im really bad at telling when people are on fire, my teammates will constantly come up to me and get pissed because I didn't pass to them enough when they we're draining shots, but when I do keep passing to them they complain that I'm forcing them into to many bad shots, how do I know when my teammates are going hot?"
816,Is this true ?,"So my guardian who helps me with basketball told me that in a game winning situation if it’s me one on one and some one wide open on the corner or wing that I should just take the 1 on 1 at least at my level . Is this true? I don’t have a problem with taking the last shot or the pressure but this just seems to go against everything in basketball, yk basketball is a team sport , no one here is lebron James type stuff .

**”Pro-B League”**
This is just my idea for how pre-NBA basketball should work. 

It would be a joint effort by the NBA and NCAA. They would pool funds to compensate players and pay coaches. From here on out the new league will be called the JVBL for “Joint Venture Basketball League”

The entity formerly known as the NCAA and its member universities would run the JVBL on a day to day basis, with member schools providing facilities and the NBA providing the bulk of the funding along with new TV deals. 

The NBA would also have input on an individual team basis. The JVBL would form a commission/commissioners office to govern itself.

My ideas are as follows-

**Structure 1:**

Increase the number of NBA teams from 30 to 40 over ten years, adding 2 new teams every other year. Each new NBA team/owner buys in at the current average NBA team price tag of ~2.5b for 25b total. 

Half of the buy in pool will be used to compensate current and former players, coaches, staff and current ownership as well as a fraction going to the NBA as a whole (commissioner’s office). The other half will go toward funding the new JVBL. 

The venture wouldn’t begin until the end of the ten years for the following reasons: The first is to allow TV deals to run out and be renegotiated. The second is to allow all 40 teams to participate equally. 

The third is to give newly minted JVBL as an organization and as individual schools time to evaluate and restructure in preparation for the new league.

**Structure 2:**

**Step 1:** Cut the number of D1 NCAA teams -now called the JVBL- down from 350 to 240* (potentially 252 with the extra 12 teams run directly by the JVBL and NBA- providing 12 teams worth of unprotected draft picks or a limited number of players comprised of former full time pros). 

**EDIT**: I think- not sure of the logistics here, you’d need those 240-252 schools to opt out of fielding D1 men’s and women’s basketball teams because the NCAA as a whole likely isn’t going anywhere. They’d free themselves up to make the leap to a standardized professional sports league.

This eliminates (to an extent) the arguments of “if you do it for one sport you gotta do it for every sport”. By taking the elite talent and the top teams- the NCAA could make a better argument for its amateurism debate and restructure, placing all remaining teams D1-D3 in a massive super league. 

Even still, they’d need to split revenue with the player base.

**Step 2:** Eliminate the G-League and integrate all resources into the JVBL. Each NBA team will then have 6 feeder teams that come with protected draft picks- unless another team is willing to pay a hefty fee to draft that player into their organization without being in their feeder program. 

Each JVBL host school has a yearly salary pool of $5M* (arbitrary yet seemingly fair and affordable number at face value) with which to compensate their players- funded by both the NBA, host school/JVBL, and TV deals Eventually ticket and merchandise sales would help to fund this system as well. 

The majority of funding would come from TV deals followed by the respective NBA organizations under which the feeder teams operate. With the initial bulk of ducking coming from a portion of the 10 team buy in. The entire salary pool would cost ~1.26 billion a year at the $5M per team figure mentioned above- which actually sounds doable until you factor in coaching, other staff and travel funds.

**Step 3:**

I think it’s necessary to adjust the court sizes and dimensions to more closely reflect the NBA. I think part of the problem now is that the college game is too different than the NBA game and this hurts young players who may struggle to make the transition. 

The JVBL doesn’t need to have the exact same rules and dimensions as the NBA but I think it would be better for the players if they were getting league type experience before actually getting to the league. 

So basically just a slightly larger court and then maybe an Olympic distance 3 point line. I’m open to suggestions on this one.


**Structure 3:**

The new JVBL would be split into 20 (21 if 252 teams) conferences consisting of 12 teams each, initially dictated by region/proximity and not TV deals/ratings. There would be opportunities to restructure after a yet unspecified time period. 

Each year, 128 teams will be eligible for the national tourney. The first, second and third ranked team of each league, as well as the conference tourney champs, earn an automatic bid. 

The remaining 48-68 teams will be discretionary picks based on win/loss and strength of schedule. No NBA team can have more than one feeder team in a given conference/league.


**Structure 4:**

The 240-252 teams that get to stay in the JVBL will be determined by previous records, team history, financial stability of host university as well as the current athletic staff- with each potential host school able to make a case for their inclusion in the JVBL. 

However, the initial potential membership pool will only consist of current D1 NCAA schools. NBA organizations will bid on feeder teams with the proceeds going to the feeder schools and the NCAA/JVBL organization as a whole. 

Every 6 years, NBA organizations and their feeder teams can restructure, meaning JVBL teams can sign with and operate under a different NBA organization if an agreement can be reached between the host/feeder JVBL school and the prospective NBA organization.


**Structure 5:**

Excluded colleges and universities’ basketball teams would revert to true amateur status but can still field teams and form leagues outside of the structure and purview of this new joint venture, and these players can still be scouted and drafted per the new rules- barring any restrictions from the new amateur league. 

Personally- I would combine all remaining D1, D2 and D3 schools into one massive amateur league, split into dozens of conferences dictated by region and proximity, or even simply by state, to allow for competitive amateur collegiate basketball at an affordable price point. 

Every 10 years the top 40 teams/universities of this “true” amateur league and the bottom 40 teams of the new joint venture league would swap places. 

The decisions will be made after only 8 years, with a 2 year grace period in effect afterwards, so that the incoming and outgoing teams/universities may make any necessary adjustments. This allows for a greater sense of competition, mobility and fairness.


**Eligibility 1:**

Players can be scouted and recruited from the season of their 14th birthday. If they’re on a team with 13 year olds- any 13 year old can be scouted but not actively recruited or contacted.


**Eligibility 2:**

Players can now attend college/join/sign to teams and start playing as young as 16; 15, if they will turn 16 within 2 months of the season opener. They are eligible to play in the JVBL until the season of their 28th birthday (I’d consider capping as young as 24 though). 

Players are eligible for the NBA draft after their first 2 years/seasons or the age of 18- whichever comes first- however any money leftover on their original deal would be forfeit in the case that they were drafted and signed to a guaranteed deal. 

On the older side- amateur players who have not yet been recruited to any of the feeder schools can be recruited to and join teams until the age of 24- also the age at which draft picks from feeder teams lose their protected status and are eligible to be drafted by any teams that want them, free of any fee.


**Education:**

Each JVBL player, no matter their age, is required to take at least 2* (potentially just for first 5 years) courses per semester at their host university as well as a financial literacy course their first year with a follow up seminar every subsequent year. 

Athletes can take up to four courses a semester at no cost, if they please. But their new status is no longer student athletes but joint NBA/JVBL employees. The classes are simply and simultaneously a job requirement and part of their compensation- most likely paid for out of their own contracts. 

The goal would be for the long term players who don’t make it to the NBA or at least don’t make it until much later to retire/move on from the JVBL with at least a Bachelors degree, trade or functional knowledge of some industry or subject matter.


Contracts and Compensation 1: Each JVBL team has 15 roster spots, 12 are contracted/signed recruits and 3 are “walk ons”, students enrolled at the host university who make the team via tryouts. 

The “walk ons” still get paid, but to a lesser degree, and on single year contracts; meaning try outs are held yearly. They also have different, stronger academic restrictions and requirements as true representatives of the school.  


**Contracts and Compensation 2:**

All non-walk-on players sign two year deals- potentially 3 (with certain restrictions), but no more. After those 2 years are up, they can a.) request to be traded/sign with another JVBL team under the same NBA organization and play immediately, b.) request out of the NBA organization and play with a new JVBL team under a different NBA organization after serving a 5-10 game suspension, c.) leave the team to pursue other things, d.) re-sign with their current team at a higher or lower price point depending on the assessment of the previous 2 seasons or e.) enter the NBA draft.  

There is no penalty for entering the draft and not being drafted- but because of the new farm system, JVBL players will know if they’re wanted and by whom, so the draft is simply a formality and anybody entering would know with near certainty whether they’re gonna be drafted and where.


**Contracts and Compensation 2:**

The JVBL team contracts would be NBA style, meaning the best, most valuable players would get paid the most and that pay would increase/decrease with skill/impact- but most importantly, the contracts are standard league wide so the max, mid and min contracts are the same for every JVBL team. 

The one caveat is that contract availability may be different for each team depending on the year and contracts of players already signed. The reason for uniform contracts is that players should want to work with an organization and staff and not chase money. 

Sometimes the timing may be wrong, but with each tiered offer being equal, players will be drawn to the organization that suits them best and cares about them most. 

Not to mention one team may offer a prospective player an available mid tier contract, while a school that wants them more may offer an available max contract- so there is still room for financial consideration via differing offers even though the max, min and mids are all uniform across the league.

**Men’s Salary:** $5M broken down as follows: Player 1: $1M- Player 2: $900K- Player 3:$700K- Player 4: $600K- Player 5: $500K- Player 6: $300K- Player 7: $225K- Player 8: $200K- Player 9: $175K- Player 10: $150K- Player 11: 125K- Player 12: $100K- Player 13: $55K- Player 14: $55K- Player 15: $55K- Again, these numbers are arbitrary. They just seemed fairly reasonable on the surface. I have no idea how well this would work, but the salaries in relation to one another seem fair enough. I could see the case for as little as $1M per team per year- but I don’t think anyone could justify more than $5M without seeing significant returns **I almost deleted this section but decided to keep it so be gentle**


**Call Ups:**

Similar to ten day contracts, NBA teams may “audition” their JVBL players by calling them up for a set number of games. And if they feel they’re immediately impactful, they can pay a fee to sign them early and have them play immediately (prior to draft/draft eligibility) provided they have an open roster spot. A JVBL player may be called up 3 times max per season for 3 games at a time.

**Send Downs:**

NBA teams would have 2-3 “reserve” spots outside of the standard 15 roster spots on their JVBL teams to send players down to. Mostly for rehab, punishment or mentorship roles. 

These players would be able to practice and travel with the teams with impunity but would be placed on minutes restrictions (max 15 mins per game, only 1 send down player allowed on the court at a time) so as not to impact the games/course of the season too much. 

A send down can only last for 5 games during the regular or pre-season and can only be done twice a season. Send downs are prohibited from participating in the conference and national tournaments, but they can still practice with feeder teams if deemed necessary- an exception which does not have a time limit.


**Coaching:**

The JVBL coaches are hired by the universities that host the JVBL teams and are still under the purview of said universities’ Athletic Departments/Directors. 

Coaches are largely independent from the NBA organizations under which they operate in terms of strategy, X’s and O’s, but the recruiting process is collaborative and the NBA teams should have just as much say in the process as the coaches. 

That being said, coaches have the final say on recruiting and contract decisions along with their host universities. The NBA teams are, however, allowed to have a representative on staff involved in team processes. 

The new JVBL still exists as its own league and sets its own quality standards and rules both on and off the court- so NBA interference should be kept to a minimum but it is important that the JVBL teams, coaches and their host universities are on good terms with the NBA organizations and the league as a whole because it is a collaborative endeavor.


**Women’s Basketball:**

I’d set up a similar system for the womens’ game. But because this is all demand/money based and fully professional it would be smaller and pay less. The WNBA would be expanded by 8 from the current 12, for 20 total teams and they would each have 12 JVBL women’s teams for 240 total teams in their lower league with 20 conferences of 12 teams each. 

They would be compensated less, but still paid fairly well ~50-75k per player* (again an arbitrary yet seemingly fair number paid out of the 10 team NBA buy in and TV deals). 

It doesn’t make a ton of financial sense, but it would be great for the game and society in general. More than likely, the women’s teams would be at the same schools as the men’s teams for the sake of convenience, at least to begin with.

**AAU: 

On a separate note, I’d also nationalize the AAU system and integrate it into the public school system. **Ironically, this is probably the most ambitious section of my entire pitch.**

There would be a city, county, state, region, national tier system - with greater levels of funding and fewer players at each tier - to ensure that the best players can still compete against one another and gain exposure to scouts while players who may not normally be able to afford to participate have that financial barrier removed. 

There would also be strict age tiers: 10-11, 12-13, 14-15, 16-17, 18-19. Kids have to play within their age group and cannot move up or down but there would be opportunities to play across age groups with JVBL/NBA camps and seminars. *A sort of champions league could be possible for all players 14 and older for the best of the best.


**AAU 2:**

This new AAU system would also introduce a greater level of structure, transparency and oversight via public school/government integration. 

There wouldn’t be just one team per tier, per city, there would be multiple (reflecting the public school system and population density of a given area), so kids would still have some choice regarding the team(s) they join and of course their desire to play with their friends/avoid unfriendly situations would be taken into consideration. 


**Funding:**

I have no idea how something like this JVBL would be funded in full. In this scenario, some people lose out on money (owners, top tier players, coaches, excluded NCAA teams), but other people gain it (JVBL players, more women, low/mid-level pros). 

Under our current system I can’t see this ever being achieved but to me it looks like a perfect world scenario for most, if not all parties eligible to play in the JVBL. Some of the money would come from the buy ins for the 10 new NBA teams at the league average of ~2.5b for ~25b total. 

TV deals would also come into play, likely providing a significant portion of funding. I think free/reduced college tuition and nationalized/single payer healthcare would be a good start in cutting league costs as well as discouraging scholarship hunting and appeasing disgruntled “athletic scholarships bad” types- but this was really just a fun thought experiment. 

Realistically it would never work- especially with all of the other sports that might like to try it, and how contingent it is on starter money coming from a ten team buy in, but like I said... would be cool.


**Reasons:**

My reasons for doing this are mostly because it’s fun to think of alternative systems. 

More importantly though: 

**1.)** I believe there is more NBA level talent than there are NBA roster spots. We’re talking about an extra 150 players. Respectfully- if you don’t think there are 150 dudes not currently in the NBA who could get down at an NBA level, you’re trippin. **I will concede that the talent pool would be diluted to a degree but in this case I think it would be fair to instate and enforce  rules against “stacking” and super team creation**

**2.)** I’d like to see the game grow. The current system bottlenecks talent, excludes and exploits young athletes with minimal payoff except for those that “make it”. 

**3.)** 1-6 years from the age of 17/18 is too short of a time for the average basketball player to establish oneself as a basketball player in a career sense. I believe it is too stressful for the average player to have that kind of weight on their shoulders. 

This system benefits kids who aren’t going to be 1 or 2 years and done the most- and it’s still a great deal for league-ready talent. In most cases the JVBL might actually get the top tier players to the NBA more quickly than the current system due to the lower age requirement and the ability to sign a player mid-season. 

**4.)** While overseas ball is an attractive option and an educational and culturally enriching experience, I’m sure players would like to make similar or more money while being able to stay at home. 

**5.)** College teams are already de facto pro teams- we should treat them as such. Allowing players to stay longer is also great for school branding and community/fan engagement. 

Instead of a 4-5 year career, or shorter, a player can stick around for 12 years under the right circumstances. 

**6.)** I believe the average JVBL player age would likely be somewhere between 21-25 but the staying power of players who may not be league-ready but can still offer high level basketball is invaluable in a world where brand recognition and loyalty are king.

**Things I Don’t Know:** 

**1.)** I don’t know how things like compliance would work out, or the legal ramifications of changing athlete’s status from student-athlete to employee. 

**2.)** Certain schools’ facilities are superior to others, with some schools lacking practice facilities or on campus gyms entirely. 

**3.)** Coaches’ salaries could potentially take a hit if the team salary is $5M (again, arbitrary yet seemingly fair number to a layman such as myself) yearly. 

**4.)** I’m not sure how exactly teams/schools would initially take being excluded from the JVBL or how the first group of member schools/teams would be selected. 

The criteria would likely be a mix of school finances, athletic history and and in person interviews from former athletes and staff.

**Extra:** 

**1.)** I could see this working with other sports, especially baseball/softball and even football to an extent but I think basketball is the best fit due to the natural room for growth and present demand. The NCAA isn’t going anywhere, but it will change and this system, at least to me is the best of both worlds. 

NIL rights would remain in place but any host school, NBA organization contracts and sponsorships take priority over individual player endorsement deals and obligations. 

**2.)** A friend of mine suggested a similar idea, but with only the top 60 or so NCAA teams playing in a sort of champions league, similar to how the Euro-League is comprised of teams that also play in leagues in their respective home countries. 

This champions league would pay its players a salary and provide a bump up in collegiate competition while not altering the system too much. I like the idea, but it seems like more of a stop-gap measure instead of something truly revolutionary.

I know this was a lengthy read, but thanks to any of you who read it in full or even just skim it. I don’t know how much I’ll be responding but I hope it inspires thoughtful discourse. Can’t wait to read what other alternative ideas or ways to improve my ideas that y’all might come up with."

I know most people have a problem with a flat shot but I seem to have the opposite problem. I'm consistently 60 degrees and higher on my shot. It's a decent one-motion shot but it feels like a moonshot and it limits my distance. Whenever I try to lower the release a bit it ends up feeling like I'm ""pushing"" it forward. Any suggestions?

Here's an interesting article I found looking at ideal shot angle. A 45 degree angle has the advantage that a couple degrees higher or lower doesn't actually change the distance of the shot that much. You can see as the angle goes up, small changes in the angle have a big effect. I've never seen that discussed before.

And I'm not fast/explosive either. My shooting isn't so great, I am very inconsistent and don't really 'feel' the ball. The shots I get in feel like luck and are hard to recreate. My backspin and arc isn't so good, the ball will go past the rim and hit the backboard or hit the front of the rim. I also feel like my shoulders are 'weak' after maybe 10 mins of shooting, my right shoulder feels like there is a weight on top of it/dull kind of pain. Also I can't really shoot the ball near the rim when on the 3 point line (maybe there's more involved than just shoulders when determining how far the ball goes). As you can see I need to improve on all aspects of my game alot. Where do I start though? I don't really know what role I play I just want to become a decent all round player with good fundamentals. I understand that work needs to be put in out of the game too. So please guys advise me how to improve all of these aspects and strength and agility/speed too.

Thank you."
849,Any tips on how to prevent knee problems for when I get older?,"I'm 38 and some of my older friends (in their 40's) have stopped playing basketball due to problems with their knees.

Any tips on how to avoid it?"
850,Concentric Speed When Squating,"So basically, I’ve moved from doing 3x10 squats to 4x4-6 squats. The main reason for this was to improve my vertical jump so that I could dunk. In doing so, I’ve also reduced my concentric time to less than 1 second, while increasing my eccentric time beyond 2 seconds. Will I still gain muscle doing this? I’ve heard muscle grows under tension, so will reducing concentric motion have any impact on that? The weight from 3x10 to 4x4-6 is the exact same.

Thanks!"

854,Quitting my team,"I started playing basketball around mid-late 2019 and I picked up the game pretty well, although there was many gaps I needed to fill I have thought I was good enough .So I joined my school team and in my our first game I was probably the best player in that game ,even though we lost I ended up putting up 16 points 5reb and 3 ast. Our next and last game of the season due to covid , I played every minute of that game and scored 15 point 4reb and 3stl and 1ast Everything started to change when my old coach left And my new coach came in , due to this new coach being extremely well known in the basketball community where I live many new people joined and this was the beginning of the end for me , there were all so much better than me I faded away became the shadow of the player I once was this made me realise I wasn’t as good as I thought I was, However I still loved playing basketball , The first moment where it all changed was a team practice I had in March , I was very bad and had multiple turnovers, after that one training session my love for basketball instantly disappeared, I began to not like playing games and going to training, although it’s not as bad as it was before, I’m thinking of quitting my team ,as next year is my last yr in school before I go off to university and if my Heart isn’t in basketball then I don’t want to do something that will cause me extra stress and plus I may even get cut from the team anyways because the new people that our trying out are very good, so what do u guys think I should do?"

858,How to improve at mature age? (Serious question),"Hi all,

I am 30 years old and play ball casually/socially. I really want to improve but I dont know where to start. I used to play alot more when I was younger and took it abit more seriously getting proper coaching etc.

I would say I've been stagnant for the past 5 years despite training by myself once a week on average. 

Anyone who coaches or plays at a high level, do you have any general tips to take my game to the next level? I want to improve as a contributing player on my team rather than be a better 1 on 1 iso player.

Btw i am 6'3 , not a bad (but not great) athlete. Can dunk, can shoot alright but not very powerful."

864,Would I be overworking?,"Im fairly new to playing Basketball and have been playing on and off for about 2-3 years. Im more focused on losing fat and overall health. I usually just practise about an hour each day from Monday to friday and the weekend I rest. If I bump it up to 2 hours a day, (perhaps 2 hours continuously or seperated) do you think I would be overworking myself? Or is it something manageable and possibly recomended?"

866,Diagnosing my ring finger shot,"Sup fellas, i have an issue that I've had since high school (31 now) and just now started to be interested enough to diagnose it. Now I'm fairly consistent in my shooting but every few shots the ball tends to come off my ring finger instead of my normal split finger style. This of course causes a slight right (right handed shooter) deviation where i won't get all net or it rides the rim and rolls out. Couldn't find anything online so i was wondering maybe someone could explain why this happens and how i could potentially fix it."
